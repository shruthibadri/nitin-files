## My thoughts on narratives
- Politics is essentially a contest for narrative dominance 
- [Deep reasons](https://twitter.com/acorn/status/92176245726511104) "To the extent that there are evolutionary reasons for people to create delusional narratives, human affairs will be trapped by them."
- [I think](https://twitter.com/acorn/status/694734782832459776) "we are all just prisoners here, of our own narratives" 
- [Facts matter less](https://twitter.com/acorn/status/1288364431261351941). "Numbers and narratives can shape each other: but in a contest between them, narratives are often more powerful than numbers."
- 'Soft power' creates an enabling environment for information warfare; more than 'power', soft power is a channel may be useful to think of "Narrative Lines of Communication" or NLOC. 

## Notes from Ajit Maan's "Narrative Warfare"
### Reference
Maan, A., (2018). Narrative Warfare. United States: CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform.
-  #definition "A narrative is a strategic story. It is the telling of a story in a certain way for a certain purpose. The way is identification. The purpose is influence."
- [Maan](https://www.narrative-strategies.com/ajit-maan) distinguishes narrative warfare from information warfare by arguing that the former is about the meaning of information. 
	- I think we can fold narrative warfare within the broader meaning of information warfare as I do in [[notebook/Conceptualising Information Warfare]]. In my classification what she defines as narrative warfare is information warfare at the epistemological level. 
- narrative warfare is a fight over meaning and identity
- ideas and narratives are different things: for instance, ISIS is not winning the battle for ideas, but their narrative is working
	- ideas often inform narratives; but it is narratives that form our ideas
- narratives are about meaning, not truth.
- credibility, not truth, matters to how influential a narrative is
	- narrator must be credible
	- narrative must reflect the experiences of the audience
- we judge others' narratives consciously and rationally only when they differ from our own; our own narratives are implicit and uncritically inherited. 
- #insight How to win a narrative conflict? Not by 'defeating' the adversary's narrative 
	- "create a shared narrative that leaves identities of all parties intact, while putting forth an alternative to (undesirable) behaviors"
