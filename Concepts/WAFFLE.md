## What is a WAFFLE?
I have observed that when people construct policy alternatives (for instance, when using Eugene Bardach's Eightfold Path to Policy Analysis during the [[Takshashila Institution]] [[notebook/GCPP]] workshop) they often come up with one that is Warm And Fuzzy Full of Lovely Everything (WAFFLE). 

A WAFFLE is not only effective, efficient and equitable but comes packed with all virtues that one can think of. It satisfies everyone. 

## Are WAFFLEs good? 
It is good to imagine a WAFFLE but risky to propose one as an option, less recommend one. 
- A WAFFLE in public policy is like a perfect black body in physics. It is an ideal and can never be achieved. It is useful because it allows us to determine how close to the WAFFLE or perfect black body a real life solution is. It helps us conceptualise what an ideal solution looks like and measure how far we are from it.  

## Why are WAFFLEs risky?
- Proposing a WAFFLE as an option is risky because:
	- You might be perceived as impractical and this might colour public/decision-makers's opinion of your proposals
	- You might be asked to implement it, in which case you risk falling short of the expectations you have created
	- If you were to take out some of the virtuous elements to make it more practical, you will be attacked by those who believe in that virtue. 

## Upshot
Create a WAFFLE in your mind but do not propose it as a policy option.
