##  Definition
Hyperdiversity is a state where a group of people are so irreconcilably different that adequate cooperation is impossible. 

If, to be successfully accomplished, a task requires the cooperation of a fraction "f" of a population "P",  then that fraction will never be achieved in a hyperdiverse society. Such a society will fall short of the productive potential of an equivalent non-hyperdiverse society. 

## Reasoning
- [[Diversity]] is subject to the law of diminishing marginal returns. For instance, it becomes increasingly difficult to choose a common restaurant to go for lunch as the diversity of the lunch-going group increases. At some point, it become impossible. 
- Hyperdiversity occurs at the point where adding more diversity makes cooperation impossible

## Relevance
- While diversity is rightly celebrated, there can be such a thing as "too much diversity." 

## Management
- The negative effects of diversity can be mitigated through strategic, social capital or coercive means. However, there are limits to the effectiveness of any or all of these methods of mitigation. 
- Where hyperdiversity is fact, or an outcome of uncompromisable values, it must be accepted and managed. 
- In hyperdiverse situations, norms, rules and policies that have evolved might lead to greater stability than exogenous ones. Alternately, exogenous norms can create instability and exacerbate hyperdiversity by reducing the incentives for reconciliation of differences. 
- Attempts to directly reduce diversity, especially through coercion, are likely to fail in hyperdiverse situations as they will evoke a strong backlash.
