## The Conundrum
- Proposition 1: In [[notebook/Conceptualising Information Warfare#The goal of information warfare]] is to achieve cognitive effects in the minds of a target population that bring about desired political outcomes. 
- Proposition 2: A state will always find it easier to persuade its own population than that of others.
- Hypothesis: Therefore in any given conflict, the state will find it easier to persuade its own population that it has prevailed than to actually prevail over its adversary. 
- Implication: Thus the incentives of those in control of a state are inconsistent and can even be opposed to state's and the public interest.

## The Resolution
- How can we address this conundrum? In theory, prior constitutional, structural and cultural safeguards must be erected to insulate a population from being information offensives of its own government. This is incredibly hard, if not impossible to do.
- How can we address this in practice? The state should be allowed only so much information offensive capability that is consistent with the domestic safeguards. The government's sword should always be weaker than the society's shield, ∀ strength of the shield. 
- However, since the sword must be strong enough to prevail over the adversary, limiting its strength to the domestic shield does not guarantee success in the international domain. For this, the strength of the shield must greater than that of the sword, ∀ strength of the sword. 
- Ergo, ==the domestic shield is the key variable in information warfare strategy==, not only for democracies, but for all states. This may be consistent with my argument that [liberal democracies have an edge](https://www.nitinpai.in/2021/07/5/liberal-democracies-have-a-fundamental-advantage-in-offensive-cyber-capability) in [[Information Warfare in the Age of Cyber Conflict]] 
- Privacy and data protection, in addition to being fundamental rights of citizens of liberal democracies, are essential elements of national security and information warfare strategy.
