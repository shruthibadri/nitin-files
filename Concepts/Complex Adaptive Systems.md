Complex Adaptive Systems
	- Core attributes: diverse, interdependent, networked entities that can adapt
	- individuals and types adapt; system doesn't; system level adaptation occurs when individuals alter their behaviours
	- even if individuals are selected for better performance, no guarantee that system performance will improve; as in the [[tragedy of the commons]]
	- [[Emergence]] refers to higher order structures and functionalities that arise from the interaction of entities in a complex system. 
	- Complexity - interesting behaviour produced by interactions of simple parts; Emergence - simpler higher order behaviour that arises from underlying complexit.  
	- Wolfram 2002 classifies systems as producing four types of outcomes: fixed points (equilibria), simple structures/periodic orbits, complexity or randomness.
