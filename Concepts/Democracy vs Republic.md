I often distinguish between democracy and republic (or liberal democracy) in the sense that the former implies majority rule and the latter safeguards individual liberty from the tyranny of the majority. The two ideas are opposed on the issue of liberty (and perhaps justice, truth and beauty as well). Where democracy considers the majority to be the ultimate arbiter of matters, a republic protects these values from being decided by their popularity. 

Such a distinction is perhaps fairly recent -- no more than 250 years old. 
Robert Dahl in the afterword of *A Preface to Democratic Theory* offers an interesting history of the words "democracy" and "republic". 
> In the eighteen century no generally accepted name existed for the kind of government that (James Madison) and his contemporaries were struggling to create: a government that acquired its legitimacy from the sovereignty of the people, but in which the people would govern indirectly by electing representatives with the power of enact the laws.

> Although classification schemes from Aristotle to Montesquieu were often presented with more nuance and subtlety than I need to explore here, a common practice was to divide constitutions or political regimes into the rule of the one, of the few, or of the many, each of which might be divided in turn into good and bad forms, depending on whether the rulers sought to achieve the common good or merely their own interests. The good and bad forms of rule by the one were monarchy or despotism. Rule by the few would be aristocracy or oligarchy. What about rule by the many? Should the good form be called a democracy or a republic? What about the bad form?

> Around 400 BCE the Athenians, drawing, naturally, on their own language, chose to call their system a "democracy," from *demos* ("the commons" or " the people") and *kratos* ("rule" "sway," or "authority"). At about the same time, the Romans called their system a republic, from the Latin *res*, thing, affair, and *publicus*, public. In the thirteenth century, when the Italian city-states of Venice, Florence, Siena, Lucca, Genoa, Bologna, and Perugia adopted constitutions providing for a measure of self-rule, they all, of course, drew on their own language and history and called their governments republics.

> To add to tbe confusion, the two terms-democracy and republic were, it appears, commonly used more or less interchangeably among Americans in the eighteenth century.My guess is that Americans who were more favorable toward rule by the people tended to use the term democracy, while those who were more dubious preferred tbe term republic.
