## Definition
Cognitive Security refers to practices, methodologies, and efforts made to defend against social engineering attempts‒intentional and unintentional manipulations of and disruptions to cognition and sensemaking. ([Cognitive Security and Education Forum](https://www.cogsec.org)) #definition 

## Notes 
- Concepts such as cognitive security and [[Narrative warfare]] are consistent with my idea on what information warfare really it. It's about hacking minds for political purposes.
- According to [Rand Waltzman](https://www.rand.org/pubs/testimonies/CT473.html) of the RAND Corporation, this field focuses on
	- "a continual arms race to influence—and protect from influence—large groups of users online." 
	- this is different from the conventional cybersecurity definition of cognitive security in three ways:
		1. it is concerned with "the exploitation of cognitive biases in large public groups"
		2. with "social influence as an end in itself"
		3. "emphasizes formality and quantitative measurement"
- Cognitive security can counter the [[notebook/The Gerasimov Doctrine]]
