## Definition
The Dichotomy of Control is an idea from Stoic philosophy that points out some things are in our control and others are not. 

## Takeaway
We should concentrate our energies on the things that we do control and make the best possible effort. Accept the outcome with equanimity. 

## Statements
> "The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control." — Epictetus, _Discourses_, 2.5.4–5 

> "If there's a remedy when trouble strikes
>What reason is there for dejection?
>And if there is no help for it
>What use is there in being glum?" — Shantideva, *The Way of the Bodhisattva*, 5:12-13 

> "You have only the right to action, never to the outcome. 
> Do not think that the outcome was due to you, nor surrender to inaction." — Krishna, *Bhagavad Gita*, 2:47

> "God, give me grace to accept with serenity  
the things that cannot be changed,  
Courage to change the things  
which should be changed,  
and the Wisdom to distinguish  
the one from the other." — Reinhold Neibuhr, The Serenity Prayer

## Cicero's Metaphor of the Archer
Massimo Pigliucci cites Cicero in "How to be a Stoic" #books 
>“Consider an archer trying to hit a target. Cicero explains that the archer has a number of things under his control: he has decided how much to train and how intensely, he has chosen a bow and an arrow as a function of the distance and type of target, he has aimed as best as he can, and he has chosen the exact moment when to let the arrow go. In other words, if he has been a conscientious archer, he has done his best up to the moment when the arrow leaves his bow. Now the question is: will the arrow hit the target? That, very clearly, is not up to him.”

## Three Levels of Influence
Pigliucci explains that we have three levels of influence over the world:
- We can make choices and select goals
- This does not mean we can implement a given course of action
- We cannot influence a lot of other things that are necessary for the given course of action to deliver the desired goals
