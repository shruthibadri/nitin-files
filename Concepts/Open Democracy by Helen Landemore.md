## Currently Reading
- In a conversation in 2021-07 on upgrading democracy for the [[Published Notes/Concepts/Information Age]] Pratap Bhanu Mehta recommended two books by Landemore: this one, and an edited volume titled *Digital Technology and Democratic Theory*. 
- Landemore's basic idea is that representative democracy is exclusionary and has run its course. It needs renewal. Her proposal for Open Democracy involves [[Leadership by Lottery]] (lottocratic), self-selected and 'liquid' representation, in addition to the electoral one. 
- She lists five core institutional principles: (1) participation rights, (2) deliberation, (3) the majoritarian principle, (4) democratic representation, and (5) transparency
	- #mythoughts 
		- three big ones are missing from this (1) individual liberty, (2) resistance to oppressive majoritarianism, (3) social effects of pervasive information. Without these open democracy is even more likely to fall to demagogues and oppressive majorities. 
		- her argument that there is good and bad populism does not address the question of how well the model can resist the bad variety
		- For Open Democracy to be an upgrade over what we have today it must work in a universal global context: and offer diverse, heterogenous and unequal societies a better system than they currently have. Which is why safeguarding individual liberty from popular opinion is crucial. 
- Would citizens necessarily participate in governing?
	- #myhypothesis 
		- the utilitarian challenge to democracy (or any system): marginal benefits of participation must exceed the marginal costs; a utilitarian citizen does not seek democracy as much as desired governance outcomes at minimal cost to oneself.
			- Landemore addresses it partly in Ch1, saying time can be found. But time is only one factor as she admits, but does not address in this chapter.
