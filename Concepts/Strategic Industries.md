The word 'strategic' is overused in business, international relations and military sciences. In economic policy, the label 'strategic' is often attached to industries and firms to enjoy regulatory relief, subsidies and other types of favourable treatment. Usually, industries and firms that are part of the defence, national security, nuclear energy and space value chains are classified as strategic. 

I had not found a non-slippery, analytically rigorous definition of 'strategic industries' until I read Glenn Diesen's [*Great Power Politics in the Fourth Industrial Revolution*](https://www.google.co.in/books/edition/Great_Power_Politics_in_the_Fourth_Indus/z0CYzQEACAAJ). It's provocative book some whose fundamental propositions do not persuade me, but nevertheless is a compelling read because tries to make a comprehensive argument about the geopolitics of the [[Published Notes/Concepts/Information Age]]. #books You don't have to agree with the author to appreciate the work. 

## Defining Strategic Industries
Diesen defines strategic industries as those which "create economic dependencies that can be converted into political capital" and "High-tech industries create dependencies and are crucial to maximizing autonomy over domestic affairs and influence over other states." The following passage is illuminating:
>Strategic industries are defined by their ability to skew the balance of dependence. Strategic industries consolidate monopolies and create high dependencies due to the limited possibility of diversification. Geoeconomic power is obtained by ‘develop[ing] exports in articles enjoying a monopolistic position in other countries and direct trade to such countries’ (Hirschman 1945: 34). 
>John Rockefeller famously argued that monopolies are where the money is made because the alternative, competitive markets drive prices down to the benefit of the consumer. Furthermore, monopolies allow economic power to be converted into political power. 
>Fruits, for example, are not a strategic industry because any disruption to supply can be resolved by merely finding another supplier, by growing one’s own fruit as a low-skilled industry, or by substituting fruits with another food group. By contrast, industries defined by natural scarcity offer fewer opportunities to diversify and more political power for the supplier. 
>Dependence on imports from strategic industries has the potential to become a ‘commercial fifth column’ by causing economic elites in the importing country to develop higher loyalties to a rival foreign power (Hirschman 1945: 29). 
>Strategic industries usually fall within one of two categories: man-made monopolies of high-tech industries and natural monopolies such as natural resources or when competitiveness is augmented by geographical proximity.
>The Fourth Industrial Revolution will increasingly elevate the strategic industries of man-made technologies above natural resources by unlocking the potential of renewable energies or by possibly even mining asteroids.

This definition (drawn from Hirshman's) is persuasive and allows for greater clarity in deciding what industries and firms are truly strategic. For instance, Russia's submarine industry and Israel's cyber weapons industry are both strategic; because they confer power on the respective states. The definition also suggests that strategic industries don't stay strategic forever: steel was once a strategic industry, but no longer.
