[[M K Gandhi]] was vehemently opposed to fountain pens because they were faster than reed pens, more expensive and not produced in villages. Many were imported. [[B R Ambedkar]], on the other hand, loved them.

On 24 September 1932 the Poona Pact was signed and Dr Rajendra Prasad, Babasaheb Ambedkar and C. Rajagopalachari were signatories. We are told, “While signing the pact, Rajagopalachari was so much overjoyed that he exchanged his fountain-pen with Dr. Ambedkar.”

It would have been quite something had Ambedkar exchanged his pen with Mahatma Gandhi’s pen. Babasaheb Ambedkar was fond of fountain pens, not reed pens. “Apart from books, he had an insatiable desire to possess fountain pens and outsize ones at that! No ordinary ones would do, and John, who attended to his pen and stationery needs, used always to scamper and collect all the outsize pens available in town and offer than to him, one by one. The Doctor would lean heavily against a show-case and try pen after pen on a writing pad, scrawling his broad sprawling autograph on its pages. At the end of these trials, he would grab half a dozen pens that he fancied and thrust them into this capacious coat pocket! It was during one such ‘pen-trial’, sometime in July 1946, that I was with him in Thacker’s shop…”

Babasaheb Ambedkar was especially fond of Parker, Sheaffer and Waterman. In Bombay (now Mumbai), his fountain pens (and other stationery) came from Thacker and Company. In Delhi, they came from Dhomimal Dharamdas, now transformed into Dhoomimal Art Gallery. Portraits, pictures and statues of Babasaheb Ambedkar often show him with a [[fountain pen]] in his hand or pocket, a symbol of modernity; Gandhiji, meanwhile, is depicted with his reed pen. One might say that the exchange of the reed pen for the fountain pen is illustrative of India’s economic transition.

Wilson pens were extremely popular and it is often stated that a Wilson pen was used to write the [[Constitution of India]], as in the title of Purvi Sanghvi’s piece. The first draft of the Constitution (26 November 1949) was indeed a work of calligraphy. Nandalal Bose and his students designed the borders. The actual Constitution was written by Prem Behari Narain Raizada (Saxena), who came from a family of calligraphers. In the process, he used 432 nibs of the No. 303 variety. Therefore, that draft of the Constitution was not written with a [[fountain pen]]; a dip pen was used instead.  The Wilson pen was used by Ambedkar to write the _draft_ of the draft, before it was handed over to Prem Behari Raizada. It is no longer possible to ascertain what happened to Ambedkar’s Wilson pen.
