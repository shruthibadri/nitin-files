## Reference
Malkasian, C. (2021). The American War in Afghanistan: A History. United States: Oxford University Press.

This is a good example of thinking at the margin. Malkasian's argument is that the marginal Taliban militant was more inspired to fight than his Afghan government adversary.

## Excerpt from the final chapter, "Looking Back"
- ...my overarching argument has been that something else, something fundamental, was equally at play in American failure. ==The answer that surfaces in the war’s long history is that the Taliban stood for what it meant to be Afghan.== The Taliban embraced rule by Islam and resistance to occupation, values that ran thick in Afghan history and defined an Afghan’s worth.

- Resistance to occupation motivated sacrifice. Tainted by its alignment with the United States, the government had a much weaker claim to these values and thus a much harder time motivating supporters to go to the same lengths. ==The average soldier and policeman simply wanted to fight less than his Taliban counterpart.== Many could not reconcile fighting for Afghanistan alongside an infidel occupier and against a movement that represented Islam.

- In battle after battle, numerically superior and well-supplied police and soldiers in intact defensive positions made a collective decision to throw in the towel rather than go another round.

- The Taliban’s battlefield successes can be tied to evidence of purposeful Taliban who believed in something versus rudderless soldiers and police..

- Islam and resistance to occupation is a necessary, albeit not sufficient, condition for the outcome of the war.

- The people supported the government in many, many places, as shown by polls and hundreds of thousands of volunteers for the army and police. More Afghans liked the government than the Taliban. And more Afghans were willing to serve on behalf of the government than the Taliban. ==But more Afghans were willing to kill and be killed on behalf of the Taliban. The Taliban had an edge in inspiration. That edge made a difference.==

- The thrust of the explanation is that foreign occupation ran against national identity and Islam and inspired people to fight.
