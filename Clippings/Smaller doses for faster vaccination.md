What is an adequate dose of the vaccine? I hadn't questioned the dose quantity until I read Tim Harford's column today. In India some hospitals eke out an 11th dose from a 10 dose vial of Covishield, using the wastage margin. If doses can be reduced even 20% without losing efficacy, then both the costs and coverage can increase by the same amount. Prudence should dominate but it's worth thinking about. 

>    There has been much talk about vaccine equity, but the main problem is not vaccine hoarding or price-gouging. It is that manufacturers can’t make doses fast enough. (If they could, then India, a huge vaccine producer, would have fully vaccinated more than 5 or 6 per cent of its population by now.)    
>     Global production has been impressive and accelerating: according to Airfinity, a life sciences analytics company, the billion-dose production mark was hit only on April 12. A billion more were produced by May 26 and the third billion by June 22. That’s good. But we need 11 billion doses to fully vaccinate 70 per cent of the world, which may not happen until 2022. 
>    Alex Tabarrok, a professor at George Mason University, has been pushing the idea of alternative dosing regimes for several months. Recently, he and other researchers, including vaccine market specialist and Nobel laureate economist Michael Kremer, released a working paper exploring the issue. At the same time, a letter advocating trials of fractional doses, written by epidemiologists Benjamin Cowling and Wey Wen Lim and a virus evolution specialist Sarah Cobey, has been published in Nature Medicine. 
>    The concept of a standard or full dose is fuzzier than one might imagine. These vaccines were developed at great speed, with a focus on effectiveness that meant erring towards high doses. Melissa Moore, a chief scientific officer at Moderna, has acknowledged this. It is plausible that we will come to regard the current doses as needlessly high. 
>    Is there a downside? If low-dose vaccines don’t work as well as studies of antibodies suggest, that is a problem that booster shots should be able to fix. 
>    More worrying is the prospect that a large pool of low-dosed people might push the virus to evolve towards vaccine resistance. Cobey acknowledges that risk but argues that if fractional doses help to reduce the number of infected people, that gives the virus fewer opportunities to mutate. Dangerous mutations might be reduced, rather than increased — it is unclear.
