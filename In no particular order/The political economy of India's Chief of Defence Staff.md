This is the outline of a talk I gave at the Hudson Institute on 2020-01-14

The appointment of a Chief of Defence Staff is one of the most significant defence reforms in independent India. But, as I explain [in my Mint column](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/opinion-appointing-a-chief-of-defence-staff-would-just-be-the-first-step-1566137008619.html), it is only the first step.

1. Caveat: Not about predicting what GOI will do, it’s about explaining the context in which defence policy is made
2. Trends and trade-offs
	1. Political focus on counter-insurgency vs Geopolitical imperatives; foreign policy seems to track domestic electoral politics
	2. Pakistan v China - which one is a bigger threat?
	3. Continental vs Maritime - where should we focus; within the political economy where army is the bigger & more frequently used force
	4. Politicisation of the armed forces — both by political leaders and by military officers; inevitable in the context of domestic counter-insurgency role; OROP agitation by veterans; rhetoric by senior officers; powerfully corrected by new army chief
	5. Procurement scandals holding up acquisitions, constant attempts to promote indigenisation 
3. History of CDS
	1. Mountbatten vs Krishna Menon in the 50s
	2. Post-1971 under Indira Gandhi, early-1980s under Rajiv; vetoed by the IAF
	3. Post-Kargil GoM, approved but stillborn; two committees Naresh Chandra & Shekatkar to review
	4. Finally implemented by Modi government. Adm Arun Prakash calls “the most significant development in the national security domain since Independence“. Goes beyond the 2001 and 2012 proposals. 
4. What will the CDS do?
	1. Politically, “jointness” was the term the PM used in his independence day speech
	2. CDS is:
		1. Principal Military Advisor to the RM on tri-service matters
		2. Permanent Chair, COSC - administer tri-service inst, including SFC
		3. Secretary, DMA - departmental & financial powers 
		4. Member, Defence Acquisitions Council
		5. Military Advisor, Nuclear Command Authority
		6. Head of the Integrated Defence Headquarters (Andaman, Special Ops, Cyber and Space)
	3. Main tasks
		1. Operational Jointness 
		2. Theatre Commands - Gen Rawat has prioritised an Air Defence Command
		3. Long term capability planning 
		4. Procurement & Asset optimisation (except capital acquisitions) 
		5. Unstated - civil-military relations; both with bureaucrats & politicians 
		6. Military diplomacy 
5. The good news
	1. CDS enjoys the trust of the political leadership and has a clear 3 year term
	2. General consensus on the need for CDS; enough staff work on what the CDS ought to be doing
	3. Professionalism in the armed forces
	4. Financial resources available — budgetary allocations available despite a slowdown in the economy
6. What are the challenges?
	1. Finding a stable and accepted place in New Delhi - parity, seniority and functional relationship vis-a-vis civilian bureaucrats, service chiefs and the NSA
	2. Relationship between and Staffing of the DMA and DOD; civilian/military balance
	3. Requires the officer to become an expert in several domain areas — nuclear strategy, defence economics, business process re-engineering and organisational design 
	4. Operational jointness; interoperability, cultural and inertial issues
	5. Resistance to restructuring — how do you define “theatres”; differing views on this among the three services.
	6. Political expertise in defence becomes necessary
