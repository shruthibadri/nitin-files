## What Chinese ideas have Indians adopted?
Indian influence on Chinese intellectual history is well-known, especially but even pre-dating Buddhist scholar-travelers. The Chinese eagerness to access Indian knowledge can be seen in the [Tang emperor's request](https://nationalinterest.in/sugar-ayurvedic-secrets-and-a-chinese-invasion-8f12c8b0cb8a) for an Ayurvedic physician from Harshavadhana's court. 

However, very little is known of the movement of ideas in the other direction. I recall asking this question at the Takshashila-Hudson conference in Bangalore in 2014.

I found an article quoting Tsinghua Institute's Wang Hui. He [says](https://news.cgtn.com/news/3d3d514e3149444f34457a6333566d54/index.html):
>"Many years ago, one of my old friends in China made a comment that in a long history, India has huge impacts on reshaping Chinese civilizations, mainly because of Buddhism. ==But on the other hand, he said we knew very little about what kinds of impacts from China over India==," said Wang, while sharing his thoughts about cultural connections, as well as how to better know our own culture.

I am keen to find out what ideas Indians adopted from China? If there were not many, why was there asymmetry in the movement of knowledge between two ancient, accomplished civilisations?
