Robert Dahl in the afterword of "A Preface to Democratic Theory"
> At the Constitutional Convention, in the *Federalist*, and in letters and other writings of the time, James Madison regularly sought to answer four questions: 
> 1. What is the new system of government to be called? 
> 2. Does a common good exist and, if so, can we know what it is?
> 3. What are the major threats to achieving the common good? 
> 4. Can these threats be overcome and, if so, how?
