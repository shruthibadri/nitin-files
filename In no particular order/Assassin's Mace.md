Excerpt From: [[Published Notes/In no particular order/The Kill Chain by Christian Brose]]

>“Under what it called its 995 Plan (named for the Belgrade embassy attack in May 1999), China accelerated work to build a different kind of military. It continued to spend money on traditional military systems, such as ships and tanks, but its priority was to develop what it called “Assassin’s Mace” weapons. The name refers to special weapons that were used in Chinese history to defeat more powerful adversaries. It would be like David and Goliath: ==the goal was not to beat the giant at its own game but to render it unable to fight by confronting its vulnerabilities.”==


- Anti-Access/Area Denial weapons are purported to belong to this category
