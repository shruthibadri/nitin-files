To round off the year 2021, I asked several of my learned and thoughtful friends to recommend one book they read this year. I go through the very interesting list of recommendations in two Takshashila [All Things Policy podcasts](https://takshashila.org.in/all-things-policy-our-2021-reading-list-part-1/). You can quickly go through the list in the show notes. 

Rear Admiral (retd) Sudarshan Shrikhande is one of our foremost thinkers on martime strategy. I'm reproducing his response in full to do full justice to his reply. 

Admiral Shrikhande writes:
>It is always difficult to share one’s thoughts on the two best books one has read in the past two years because how do you distinguish between good and best in books?  It is sometimes difficult to even recall some  titles of the books one has read. This becomes especially problematic because of the diverse reading one needs to do “in the line of duty” leading me to confess that  I  do read most pages of many books, but these days very few that I could say are from cover to cover. This is a shortcoming of mine that   may not be so uncommon. There are two books I mention here among those  that I did read carefully. One is fiction, but the characters seem life-like and the other is about WW2.

>Victor Davis Hanson’s [The Second World Wars: How the First Global Conflict was Fought and Won](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34184217-the-second-world-wars) (New York, Basic Books, 2017/ Paperback 2020) is curiously titled. “Wars” is in plural, when we have all grown old thinking it was one war. VDH explains that the sheer canvas of the war was global and not tightly connected, yet with cause and effect that could be connected. For example in Chinese  thinking WW2 for them started in the mid 1930s, or for people in North Africa finishing earlier than 1945. Second because it was fought in so many different ways the plural seems apt too. In some ways, I buttoned on to the book because it examines the war in themes (Ideas, Air, Water, Earth, Fire, People and Ends) somewhat like his superb examination of the Peloponnesian War ([A War Like No Other](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/531.A_War_Like_No_Other)). He writes elegantly, argues dispassionately in a fascinating descriptive and analytical framework. There are some fine discussions on the book on YouTube.com.

>Anton Myrer’s [Once an Eagle](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38876.Once_an_Eagle) (New York, Harper Collins/ Perennial, 1968) is an older book that I read once again in 2019 about 10 years after I first did so. This big, nearly 1300-page novel, is considered cult reading in  the US Army and Marine Corps. Strangely, for their Navy and Air Forces it is less so even when it has great learning (and for me) teaching value across armed forces and across cultures. The two main characters, Sam Damon and Courtney Massengale are depicted as contrasts in terms of their backgrounds, their form of entry into the US Army, their qualities of character and their value systems. At times the starkness seems exaggerated, but over the years I realised that Myers perhaps did this to illustrate—especially to military readers and leaders—that good and bad officers and leaders live, work, compete, lead and win and lose in the grey world of reality.

>I have been trying to explain in discussions on ethics and leadership (two sides of the coin of officer-ship as I  and put it) in various military institutions that Once an Eagle also helps us ponder why some young cadets and officers join wanting to be the good, model  officer like Sam Damon is in his uneven rise from a Private to a general officer in wars and peace spanning decades end up being Courtney Massengales. This fellow comes from the “right side of the tracks;” is a West Point Graduate; knows several generals who assist him in getting right assignments and even relatively safer combat experience. Both officers are shown to be highly intelligent, driven in their own way. Sam seems committed to the Army, Courtney to himself! In some pages the story almost seemed to lose its grip when I first read it. Then, over the years as I read some passages to apply to one’s own exposure to Courtneys and Sams, and to other readings on military ethics and leadership, there seemed to be value and lessons in the slower, meandering pages of the book that include peace time soldiering. 
>
>Officership and leadership are important always and not only in combat where Myers paints vivid pictures of valour, courage, confusion and cowardice. The twist in the tale, which I was of course aware of during my second reading, became revealing in a manner different from a decade earlier. I feel that this book is a thoughtful story for all readers, not merely military.
