Citing supply disruptions and loss of industry revenues over the past couple of years Chad Brown argues that Trump's tech war has backfired. 

I am not sure if that conclusion can be arrived at just yet. Export controls would certainly cause short-term fluctuations some of which are predictable and others not. Even so, the tech war is strategic and its consequences will not be substantively felt so early. The investment cycle itself is perhaps 18 months or more. 

But I agree with Brown's argument about a collaborative approach among partner countries. It is consistent with my [[Bubbles of Trust]] approach.

> Washington and its partners will also need to get more creative. Both the U.S.-Japanese and U.S.-South Korean summits signaled the potential embrace of an innovative policy called “Open RAN.” Under this approach, policymakers would agree on common industry standards that force greater compatibility between different types of 5G equipment. The end goal is to prevent Huawei—or any other 5G equipment provider—from dominating global telecommunications infrastructure. This policy would introduce competition and could weaken the market power of major vendors. It may also be more effective than the existing approach: better to allow for a diversity of suppliers than dedicate resources to killing off one bad actor, such as Huawei, only to see another take its place.

> Nevertheless, the United States and its partners will have to accept that aligning their policies comes with costs. If they agree to common export controls, for instance, China will almost certainly carry out a more confrontational foreign and economic policy, intensifying its own efforts to decouple. In turn, semiconductor firms in U.S. partner countries will likely join their American counterparts in losing commercial access to the Chinese market.

To ease the sting, they should jointly fund an R & D consortium for firms in allied countries along the semiconductor supply chain.  R& D consortiums, which pool resources for chip research to prevent each company from having to reinvent the wheel, are nothing new for the chip sector at the national level. In fact, Japan developed one in the 1970s, as did South Korea, [Taiwan](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2021-06-03/china-taiwan-war-temptation), and the United States shortly thereafter. ==Here, coordinating a new multilateral consortium could also help allied countries withstand pressure to compete among themselves, thus preventing excessive subsidization and a race to the bottom.==

But failing to coordinate the export controls needed to mitigate the most critical national security threats, develop common industry standards, and prevent excessive subsidies to stave off infighting over suppliers—that would be much, much worse.
