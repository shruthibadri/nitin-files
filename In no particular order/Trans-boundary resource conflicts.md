## Background
There is a class of problems in public policy that involve resource conflicts across political boundaries. Frequently, but not always, the conflict concerns the sharing and exploitation of natural resources like arable land, water, fisheries and minerals. Neither the political geography nor the economic geography necessarily coincides with the physical geography of resource distribution. The political boundaries can be either international or sub-national. 

Fishing disputes in the Palk Strait between India and Sri Lanka are an example of an international dispute. River water sharing in the Kaveri basin is an instance of a sub-national dispute. 

## Analytical Framework
Addressing this policy problem requires us to *simultaneously*: 
1. Address the non-congruence of political and physical geographies
2. Optimise resource management in an economically efficient manner
3. Manage the political economy from both the power and equity angles
4. Optimise resource management for sustainability of the resource, of the regional eco-system and the global environment.
