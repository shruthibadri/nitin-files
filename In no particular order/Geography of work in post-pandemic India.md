This is an estimate on how the geography of knowledge work will change in India over 2021-2025 based on my experience and discussions with other employers, mainly in Bangalore. 

Note: This is focused on the urban economy and knowledge industries and does not readily apply to industrial, commercial, infrastructural and rural sectors. 

### Assumptions

1. Many firms have developed the mindsets and methods for geographically distributed workforces.
2. Many firms have discovered the relative pros and cons of centralised offices vs distributed work-from-home configurations. 
3. Firms and workforce members will both want to retain the benefits of the pandemic-era arrangements; and fix the downsides.
4. Firms have a natural incentive to attract investment, boost revenues, increase quality & quantity of output, reduce costs, attract & retain good talent, maintain positive brand image. 
5. Workforce members have a natural incentive to raise incomes, seek better working environments, flexible schedules, improve career prospects, reduce costs, better social life, optimise family arrangements.

### How might things change

**Overall:** Some fraction of firms will reconfigure their operations in a manner that some fraction of their workforce will work outside-the-office for some fraction of time. 

- **Trend 1 - extra-city movement:** Net increase in employees working outside big offices, outside city centres and outside big cities. Smaller cities with good schools, environment, access and career opporunities will benefit.
- **Trend 2 - satellite-offices:** Net increase in satellite offices and co-working locations in tier-1 cities as well as tier-2 and smaller cities. 
- **Trend 3 - hybrid workplaces:** Net increase in technology-assisted working hours where on-site and remote-workers work together in non-meeting settings.
- **Trend 4 - talent relocation:** Change in home base of top managers and key employees to ensure operational excellence and business continuity in the post-pandemic work geography
- **Trend 5 - reprogramming of travel:** Change in the reasons and persons who travel on business
	- Increase in remote workforce periodic travels to main-office or satellite office
	- Decrease in executive travel for pro forma and regulatory compliance meetings
	- Resumption in executive travel for high-quality and high-impact interactions (customer meetings, investor meetings, contact with remote-teams)
	- Changes in travel for training
	- Change to daily commute 
- **Trend 6 - reformatting of training:** Many forms of training involving teaching how to do things "step-by-step" will move online; training that has strong inter-personal, leadership, public policy and communications elements will have strong offline base.
- **Trend 7 - reformatting of events and conferences:** The direction of this trend is uncertain. Purely online events serve a small fraction of the utility and business value of conferences and events. The trajectory of the pandemic will determine when MICE will return. The more distributed a workforce is and the less risky it is to convene events, the higher the value of more MICE.
- **Trend 8 - shift in housing patterns:** Reduction in demand for certain types of housing in Tier-1 cities and neighbourhoods; increase in demand for certain types of houses outside cities (suburban); increase in demand for housing in many tier-2 cities. 
- **Trend 9 - reconfiguration of employee benefits:** fitness, sports and club memberships, changes to transport and housing allowances, allowances for home productivity improvements   
- **Trend 10 - disproportionate gender effects:** Opportunity for more women to join the workforce (this is an important factor but uncertain). Increase in overall workload for working women albeit with greater flexibility. 
- **Trend 11 - change to the family home:** Young, single adults likely to stay longer with parents; working couples likely to move to their own houses; houses will require different interior configurations. 
- **Trend 12 - greater demand for online home services:** including domestic help, food delivery, repairs, etc.


### Some opportunities
- To the extent that companies adopt geographically distributed workforces, there will be a need for high quality venues, events and programming; both in big cities as well as where there are satellite offices.
	- Shoba Narayan adds that there will be hunger for community/Adda/salon type of situations.
