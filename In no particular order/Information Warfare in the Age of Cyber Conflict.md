## Notes
   - the editors distinguish information warfare from cyber warfare
	   > Cyber warfare and information warfare are different beasts. To be sure, the two are consistently held by experts to be adjacent concepts or approaches to contestation. Both concern information; but where the former does so exclusively in its digitized and operationalized form, the latter does so in a much broader sense. With IW, information itself is the weapon. In cyber conflict, information systems are leveraged as terrain over which diverse effects might be realized. Even given such a distinction, however, the space between cyber and IW has often seemed minimal to the point of negligible
  - Alludes to authoritarian states preferring information warfare; as did [[IISS Report on Cyber Capabilities and National Power]]
  - Martin Libicki argues that US must adopt information warfare (hacking minds) like its adversaries; for information defence he recommends adopting a crime-fighting mindset. 
 	 > The terms war and warfare suggest a military response, and one cannot completely rule out circumstances in which the only way to reduce suffering from an IW campaign to within reasonable levels is to threaten force. But many characteristics of IW—nonlethality, ambiguity, and persistence—suggest using the same mindset, tools, and rules used against crime. Much crime fighting involves changing the environment. The moral environment affects an individual’s propensity to join a fight; it includes ethical norms and the social influences that arise when communities alternatively applaud, excuse, or shun criminals. The physical environment can also be changed.
  - Elsa B Kania on China - in the information domain, China is on the tactical offensive but on the strategic defensive ("active defence"); ie it feels under ideological threat from the West, and defending itself requires poking the US
  	>  Xi Jinping’s agenda to build China into a powerful cyber nation or “cyber superpower” (网络强国) has included an emphasis on “online public opinion work” as an integral element of its broader agenda for propaganda and ideological work, linking online and offline efforts. 
  	>   Xi Jinping has called for China to concentrate on pursuing the “right to speak” or “discourse power” (话语权, huayuquan). 
  - Trevor Thrall and Andrew Armstrong -  it's really a marketplace of values, not ideas; and people's opinions are tethered to their prior beliefs, they are less likely to be swayed by information operations. This is the defence against manipulation. 
	>The marketplace of ideas model is undeniably elegant and compelling, an Enlightenment-era cocktail of Bayesian opinion formation, free speech, and capitalism. Unfortunately, its most foundational premise is false. As Mark Twain once mused, “truth is mighty and will prevail. There is nothing wrong with this, except that it ain’t so.” #quote 
	>...the market’s failure was not as significant as is often portrayed and that it is less vulnerable to foreign interference than many believe. In part, ironically, this is due to the fact that the American marketplace of ideas does not function nearly so well under normal circumstances as most people think. In reality it is expansive, noisy, full of propaganda and misinformation of domestic origins, and slow to correct itself at the best of times. The addition of a little more partisan propaganda and conspiracy theorizing in 2016 was unlikely to move the needle much.
