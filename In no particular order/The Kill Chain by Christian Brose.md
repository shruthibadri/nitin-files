## Notes
- The "kill chain"
	- information, understanding, decision-making, action
	- is a new term linked to the information revolution; earlier, kill chains were confined within their own platforms. 
		- the IT revolution disaggregated the kill chain
		- taken together tech has trandformed the entire kill chain
	- most armed forces are unable to work across systems and platforms 
- Objective function of defence forces: “ the goal of a military should not be to buy platforms. The goal is to buy deterrence, the prevention of war. And the only way to deter wars is to be so clearly capable of winning them that no rival power ever seeks to get its way through violence.”
- Objective function of defence reform: “The real goal, however, is a more effective kill chain—achieving better understanding, making better decisions, and taking better actions.”

- Defence manufacturers are hardware companies and do not have the same dynamism as software companies (which have much shorter cycles and costs)
- [[Published Notes/In no particular order/battle networks]] of the future will have fewer humans than machines, overturning the ratio for the first time. This will suit Western armed forces which face manpower shortages.
- Military Internet of Things will be built on "human command and machine control" and lead to a better division of labour between the two. 
- "human preferences and limitations will be even less of a factor in how military machines will be designed."
- "The primary purpose of human beings in military affairs is their moral agency, their capacity to make strategic, operational, and ethical decisions, especially about the use of violence in war."
- How information will change movement, "shooting" and communications (the three aspects of war) 
- (to be completed)
