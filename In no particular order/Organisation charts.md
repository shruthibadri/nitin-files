We are familiar with organisation structures of the Industrial Age. Regardless of clever phrasing and unusual job titles the structures are almost always hierarchical. Information flows up the hierarchy, decisions tend to get made at higher levels than they need to, orders get transmitted down until they are finally executed. The sensors and the actuators are at lower levels while decision makers and resource allocators are at higher levels. Governments, armed forces, corporations and social organisations are structured along these lines. There are pyramids and silos. 

In the [[notebook/Information Age]], when everyone is connected, we have networked societies. Information flows horizontally, simultaneously, through multiple paths. We are already what I have called [[Radically Networked Societies]]. Informal organisations are already flat and networked. Formal organisations, however, still retain their Industrial Age blueprints. Customers are networked, but their service providers are hierarchical. Citizens are networked, but governments are hierarchical. Security threats are networked, but security forces are hierarchical. The mathematics is clear: hierarchical organisations take much longer to process information. Their [[OODA loops]] are much slower than those of their customers and stakeholders. [My 2015 paper](https://takshashila.org.in/book-chapter-politics-of-radically-networked-societies/) goes into the political implications of this insight.

We do not have good organisational models for the Information Age. At [[Takshashila Institution]] we are organised as a number of intersecting circles or orbits. Each big circle consists of all people concerned with delivering a particular type of organisational output. People working on the same project are placed next to each other and labelled in the same colour. The challenge is to represent it simply and in two dimensions --- requiring the same person ('Manjunath', in the figure below) to be placed in multiple rings if they happen to be away from each other. There is some hierarchy, which I have found is unavoidable for accountability and coordination, but the driving principle is a non-hierarchical network.
