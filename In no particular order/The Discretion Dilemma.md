## Proposition 
**The Discretion Dilemma**: Effective governance requires public officials to apply their mind and use judgement in the interpretation and application of rules. However, public officials could use these powers for ulterior motives. 

**Meta Discretion Dilemma**: When there is widespread suspicion that public officials will use discretion for ulterior motives, rules and processes are made to prevent its exercise. However, since every rule or process requires some amount of discretion, such rules incease the need for discretion. Usually this only shifts the need for the exercise of judgement to another agency (a tribunal or judiciary).   

## How do we address this dilemma?
- Organisational oversight: peers/superior officials can review decisions. However, they too will be subject to the dilemma. 
- Transparency: Like judicial verdicts, publish decisions and reasons. This can be cumbersome, and in the absence of trust and an efficient judicial apparatus, expose officials to litigation. Moreover, where "the right thing" is unpopular, public opinion can press the official to avoid it. 
- Removal of discretion: Can create gross violations of principles of fairness and justice; non-compliance/evasion; using artificial intelligence in judicial processes suffers from this weakness. 
- Education: a system of liberal education, as envisaged by Thomas Jefferson and others, can theoretically create a pool of enlightened public officials who would do the right thing. Even if this ideal can be attained, how do we get from here to there. 
- Institutional culture: strong institutional culture, where doing "the right thing" is upheld through norms, status-mechanisms and incentives. Where such institutions already exist, they must be protected (institutional conservatism). Where they do not, the question again is how do we get from here to there.
- [[notebook/Hyperdiversity]] exacerbates the discretion dilemma by throwing up multiple contesting legitimacies and understandings of "the right thing"

## Comments
- My understanding of  [Vikas Argod's comment](https://twitter.com/vikasargod/status/1458324324847263749) is that the dilemma is actually an accountability problem.
	> Autonomy of processes" and "accountability on outcomes" should be seen directly proportional. Higher (or lower) autonomy higher (or lower) accountability. One can't be higher and the other be lower. 
	- Ergo, if public officials are held accountable for outcomes, then the discretion dilemma will take care of itself. That being so, it is quite hard to hold officials accountable for "outcomes" and the best we can do is hold them accountable for "outputs", which brings us back to the discretion dilemma.
