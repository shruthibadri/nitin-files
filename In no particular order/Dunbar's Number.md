Humans can only maintain 150 quality relationships.

Robin Dunbar [writes](https://theconversation.com/dunbars-number-why-my-theory-that-humans-can-only-maintain-150-friendships-has-withstood-30-years-of-scrutiny-160676) "Dunbar’s number applies to quality relationships, not to acquaintances – which account for the more casual outer layers of our social networks, beyond our 150 meaningful friendships...and we can only maintain five intimate friendships – but we know the names of up to 1,500 people."
