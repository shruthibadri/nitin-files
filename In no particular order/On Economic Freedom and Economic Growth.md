## Observation
Economic freedom and economic growth are correlated.  

## Proposition
- de Haan and Sturm show that "greater economic freedom fosters economic growth" but the level of economic freedom is not related to growth. [On the relationship between economic freedom and economic growth - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0176268099000658) 
- de Haan and Sturm also claim that the causal relationship is robust [How robust is the relationship between economic freedom and economic growth?: Applied Economics: Vol 33, No 7](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00036840121977)
- Heckelman's work supports the causal argument [Economic Freedom and Economic Growth: A Short-Run Causal Investigation: Journal of Applied Economics: Vol 3, No 1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15140326.2000.12040546)
- Some further claim that this leads to greater political freedom [Economic Freedom, Political Freedom, and Economic Well-Being: A Causality Analysis Economic Freedom and the Wealth of Nations 18 Cato Journal 1998-1999](https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/catoj18&div=21&id=&page=)
- My  blog post from 2004 correlates economic freedom and human development [Economic Freedom and Human Development Go Together Too](https://www.nitinpai.in/2004/02/27/economic-freedom-and-human-development-go-together-too) and to lower corruption [Societies With Greater Economic Freedom Have Lower Corruption](https://www.nitinpai.in/2011/04/11/societies-with-greater-economic-freedom-have-lower-corruption) 

## Thoughts
- There is sufficient evidence to connect economic freedom as being instrumental in creating economic growth and prosperity. 
- I am also inclined to accept that economic freedom has intrinsic value, and would be desirable even if it did not create growth. Others might not share this belief. 
- In any case, the conceptual origin of economic freedom could be seen as arising from (a) the grace, sufference and discretion of the government/collective; or (b) the fundamental rights of the individual. Either position is an arbitrary social construct but possibly has different consequences.
- If economic freedom arises as a privilege granted by the state/collective:
	- it can be just as easily abridged or withdrawn without formal grounds of challenge, appeal or redress
	- will influence the risk perception of investors and attract certain types of investors and investments. These are likely to be short-term, non-capital investments. 
	- track record of the grantor can influence investor risks to varying extents
	- growth is still possible under such a regime
- If economic freedom arises from an individual right
	- it cannot be easily abridged or withdrawn; and there will be formal grounds of challenge, appeal and redress
	- will influence risk perception of investors; longer-term investments are likely if other conditions are satisfied. 
	- track record of the grantor can influence investor risk perception, especially in the short-term 
	- growth is possible under such a regime; and more likely over the longer term.
