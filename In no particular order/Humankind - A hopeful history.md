Rutger Bregman's [Humankind - A hopeful history](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52879286-humankind) is among the more interesting books I read in [[2020]]. 
- There is something in the core argument -- that society becomes what it believes it is -- and believing that our species is positive, optimistic and altruistic is likely to bring about the outcome than otherwise.
	> If you believe something enough, it can become real. If there’s one lesson to be drawn from the nocebo effect, it’s that ideas are never merely ideas. We are what we believe. We find what we go looking for. And what we predict, comes to pass. Maybe you see where I’m going with this: our grim view of humanity is also a nocebo.
- Bregman calls this realism, although Realists take the opposite view. 
	>My argument is simply this: that we – by nature, as children, on an uninhabited island, when war breaks out, when crisis hits – have a powerful preference for our good side. I will present the considerable scientific evidence showing just how realistic a more positive view of human nature is. At the same time, I’m convinced it could be more of a reality if we’d start to believe it.
- The evidence and stories presented are in the nature of "everything you thought was true is not quite so." Not all of it is convincing. Even so, there is enough to string together a coherent narrative. 
- This is consistent with #mythoughts about [[Hope]]: hope is effectively an irrational belief, hope is not a policy, but hope can be a strategy when there is no other strategy left. Without hope, people surrender and bring about the very outcome they do not want. With hope, people fight and thus have a chance of winning. 
	- Religious and ideologically indoctrinated people are a step up on this: they have faith in their eventual triumph. On the margin this gives them psychological advantage against more rational opponents. 
- Bregman is on more solid ground when he argues that news is an addictive substance that is undermining civilisation.
> - The news, according to dozens of studies, is a mental health hazard
> - Why are we humans so susceptible to the doom and gloom of the news? Two reasons. The first is what psychologists call negativity bias: we’re more attuned to the bad than the good. 
> - Second, we’re also burdened with an availability bias. If we can easily recall examples of a given thing, we assume that thing is relatively common. 
> - As [[Nicholas Nassim Taleb]] dryly notes, ‘We are not rational enough to be exposed to the press’.
- Empathy can be misleading. 
>Just as empathy misleads us by zooming in on the specific, the news deceives us by zooming in on the exceptional.
