## Proposition
- Not only leaders but also people in democratic societies conflate [[notebook/Power and Governance]]; and want their co-identitarian to have power.
	- Politics is about appealing to me-sized relative benefits (in terms of power and spoils), and when diversity increases, this necessitates political coalitions or social coalitions (vote-bank combinations)
- The civil service is supposed to provide governance expertise, but it is endogenous and will suffer the same limitations in terms of competence, composition and culture. In any case it is subservient to political power. 
- A third institution may be useful: it should representative as suggested in [[Open Democracy by Helen Landemore]], but deliberative, non-electoral, non-permanent, open and inclusive. Political leaders can still reject its recommendations, but such rejection will have to explain (or at least be visible as) the deviation from the public interest. 
	- This could be baked into legislation (start with rules, instead of laws)
	- Next step it could be legislated into the constitution as a consultative process 

Connected to citizens have high problem articulation capacity but low solutions expertise, especially in non-intuitive macro policy contexts; experts have lower problem articulation capacity but high technical solutioning skills. We need a process to bridge this.
