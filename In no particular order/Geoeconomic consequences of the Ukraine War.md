## Implications for India

### How did we get here?
A shift in the world order as it enters the [[notebook/Information Age]]
- Xi Jinping pressed the Undo button from 2012
- Covid-19 and post-Covid
- Western macroeconomic policies since 2008
- Populism and reaction, especially in US
- Ukraine war

### Preliminary Assessment
Outcomes of a complex system will oscillate and eventually settle down if control mechanisms kick-in. In a typical second order response the questions are how big is the shift, how long are the up & down swings and how long will it take to settle down. In simple terms: there will be fluctuations and a lot of volatility. 

#### Short-term uncertainty, reaction & opportunism
- Economic and technological nationalism: localisation, indigenisation
- Fluctuations in wheat and energy markets
- Possible controls on trade in essential/strategic commodities
- Fiscal policy: spending and taxation
- Scramble for rouble alternatives

#### Consequences of the sanctions regime
   
- To what extent will second-order & indirect countries, companies and individuals be targeted?
- To what extent will dollar transactions shift to barter, crypto and Chinese yuan?
- How long will sanctions regime remain in place? 

#### Medium-term economic Balkanisation
   
- Acceleration of geopolitics-driven reorientation of supply chains. If you are not “in”, you are out.
- Semiconductor and high tech: sharper trade-off between competitive edge vs market size
- Inflation, labour demographics & success of WFH will drive business to lower-cost countries. But.
- Access to, and costs of Lithium, Palladium, Platinum. Also potential nationalist backlashes against foreign mining companies.

#### Globalisation under question
  
- The role of MNCs and FDI as I [wrote in my Mint column](https://www.nitinpai.in/2022/03/14/the-closing-of-mcdonald-s-in-moscow-is-bad-news-for-the-global-economy)
- Higher global and domestic political risks for tech companies, platforms and bio
- Salience of crypto: pro-crypto jurisdictions will benefit but face geopolitical risks
- To what extent will foreign investors flee emerging markets
- India is outside RCEP & has few PTAs/FTAs.

#### Silver linings
   
Nuclear power and LNG demonstrated their utility
Interconnectedness is an important stabilising factor – bubbles of trust approach is a way forward
New global governance platforms (like G20) are likely  

#### Bottomline
To shape geopolitical and geoeconomic outcomes India must be on the winning side of this conflict (unlike in World War 2 and the Cold War). See my recommendations for [[Indian foreign policy after the Russia-Ukraine war]]
