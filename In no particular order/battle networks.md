From [[Published Notes/In no particular order/The Kill Chain by Christian Brose]]

>“A battle network is the means by which militaries close the kill chain.”

>“It is what enables them to understand, decide, and act. Battle networks consist of people and things—things that sense, things that shoot, and things that share information. A battle network is often highly complex, but at the most basic level, it is only those three things. Sensors provide information about what is happening. That information is shared across the network to “shooters,” which take action."

>“Each piece of the battle network is indispensable, but it is the sharing of information that is most important, and most often overlooked...Indeed, without the ability to share information well, there is no battle network, and the result is that it takes more time, more people, and more money to close the kill chain.”
