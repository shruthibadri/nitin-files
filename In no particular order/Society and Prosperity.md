## What makes a free society orderly and stable?
- It is the manner in which a free society organises itself determines its stability. This includes laws, constitutions, professed values on the one hand and cultural norms and practices on the other. 
- Social organisation must be equitable, efficient and effective; and its discontents at the margins. 
	- the marginal cost of discontent must be higher than the marginal benefits; this happens when the discontent can be accommodated, alleviated or addressed without its expression challenging the order. 

## What makes a free society prosperous?
- Economic growth. What causes economic growth? Higher productivity. What causes higher productivity? The use of tools.
	- If human endowments are the same across the world; and if social organisation is similar; then difference in tool use *might* largely determine productivity growth. The better the tools, the more skilfully they are employed, the better the social organisation of their employment, the higher that society's productivity. And thus, higher its prosperity.
	- Why do some societies use tools better than others? Social organisation and culture are *likely* factors that determine this. Of course, there is the [[Basic Trinity]]
