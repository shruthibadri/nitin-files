I think these are the fundamental questions for cyber strategy. 
1. What constitutes power in the [[notebook/Information Age]]?
2. How is that power accumulated and dissipated?
3. How does cyber power relate to military power and economic power? What proportion of overall national power will cyber power constitute? 
4. How can the power be used? What are its possibilities and limitations?
5. Who will be the political actors in the information age? Who has and will acquire power?
6. How will the world be ordered? 
7. If nation-states remain principal actors, how will the global balance of power change?
