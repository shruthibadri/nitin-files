## Concept
Sortition, lottocracy is the idea that representatives can be chosen by lottery. 

In [[Open Democracy by Helen Landemore]] #books : 
>Lottocratic representatives are selected by lot and frequently rotated. The combination of sortition and rotation ensures that lottocratic assemblies are accessible and “open” to all, not spatially speaking, since those not selected are excluded, but over time.

Alexander Guerrero makes the case for lottocracy in this 2014 [Aeon essay](https://aeon.co/essays/forget-voting-it-s-time-to-start-choosing-our-leaders-by-lottery).

## Experiments and Trials
Landemore:  
>In 2019, in Belgium, the Parliament of the German-speaking community voted to establish a randomly chosen Citizens’ Council to help the elected parliament chamber formulate legislation. 

## In Fiction
Scanning my Kindle notes in 2021-07 I found this #clipping. There's something here for [[notebook/Information Age]] [[Organisation charts]]. #books 

> “Raj has been at Google a long time,” Kat says. 
> We’re wandering away from the mess hall. I snagged an extra cookie on the way out, and I’m nibbling on it now. “He’s pre-IPO and he was PM for ages."
> The acronyms at this place! But I think I know this one. “Wait”—I’m confused—“Google has a prime minister?” 
> “Ha, no,” she says. “Product Management. It’s a committee. It used to be two people, then it was four, now it’s bigger. Sixty-four. The PM runs the company. They approve new projects, assign engineers, allocate resources.” 
> “So these are all the top executives.” “No, that’s the thing. It’s a lottery. Your name gets drawn and you serve on the PM for twelve months. Anybody could be chosen. Raj, Finn, me. Pepper.” 
> “Pepper?” 
> “The chef.” 
> Wow—it’s so egalitarian it’s beyond democracy. 
> I realize: “It’s jury duty.” 
> “You’re not eligible until you’ve worked here for a year,” Kat explains. “And you can get out of it if you’re working on something super-super-important. But people take it really seriously.” 
> I wonder if Kat Potente has been summoned. 
> She shakes her head. “Not yet,” she says. “But I’d love to do it. I mean, the odds aren’t great. Thirty thousand people work here, there are sixty-four on the PM. You do the math. But it’s growing all the time. People say they might expand it again.” 
> Now I’m wondering what it would be like if we ran the whole country like this.
