The Economist's Daily Chart shows a correlation between Olympics performance and economic output.

>An analysis by _The Economist_ finds that economics determines much of Olympic glory. We tested the relationship between a battery of variables—population, health, education and economic output—and the share of Olympic medals won in each Olympic games. We found that share of world GDP was the single biggest factor in determining success. GDP alone explains 55% of the variation in Olympic medals won since 1960. On average, holding other things constant, a two percentage-point share of global GDP (measured at purchasing-power parity) translates to a three percentage-point share of Olympics medals.

>Some countries overperform at the Olympics relative to their economic output...Way behind is India, which performs dismally compared with what might be expected from its share of economic output (currently 7%). 

## Comment
- The chart is about Olympics performance but makes a more general point. It shows that India's performance has long been below the trend line. Reflecting on "why" this might be the case holds answers to many other public policy questions.
- #myhypothesis: This has to do with the fundamental mindsets that determine how we organise our society.
	- I have learnt that whenever there is a gap between potential and performance, "look at organisation."
	- If you put resistors in series, they add up. If you put capacitors in series, they divide up. You might have good components, but if you don't assemble them properly, the resultant will be sub-optimal. (#electricalengineering)
- There is a need to reform, re-engineer and invest in sports administration. But it goes beyond that. We need to address something more fundamental than leadership, management, budgets and so on.
- We need to reflect on our society's understanding, appreciation and valuation of talent. We need to reflect on the criteria society uses for selection in general, and the prioritisation, weightage and balance of effectiveness, efficiency and equity.
- Some questions for reflection:
	- To what extent does society nourish the brightest and the best?
	- To what extent do the brightest and the best contribute to society?
- We need to change these equations. My sense is that they are quite broken. The few successes we see are exceptions. The chart reveals the extent of the underperformance.
