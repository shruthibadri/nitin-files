## Reference
[Elizabeth](https://neurotree.org/beta/publications.php?pid=26603) and [Robert Bjork](https://neurotree.org/beta/publications.php?pid=2564) -  TEDx Talk on [How to study to maximise performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NIXM74NwXs) (2019)

## Main points
- knowing how to learn is an ultimate survival tool
- use [desirable difficulties](https://bjorklab.psych.ucla.edu/research/#itemII) for learning; four most important
	- varying the conditions of learning and practice 
		- change where, what, when; the place of study, practice different shots, 
	- spaced repetition
		- cramming works on a very short-term; no good for real learning 
	- retrieving rather than reviewing
		- explain to others, teach others
	- interleaving our study or practice (instead of blocking) 
		- blocking shows better results in practice, but interleaving works better in real life
		- jumble up maths problems
