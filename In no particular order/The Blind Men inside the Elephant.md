The parable of the [Blind Men and the Elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant) is well known and has fairly ancient origins. In its simplest form, it is about people mistakenly claiming to know the whole by extrapolating the part that they can sense, or are familiar with. 

In the context of re-inventing organisations, we often do not know the outcome of the changes we are trying to make. It is hard to see the changes from the inside. This is like a group of people inside the belly of the animal trying to describe what the Elephant looks like, without ever having been outside. They might be able to see, maybe even see the entirety of the inside, but they still cannot know what the animal looks like.
