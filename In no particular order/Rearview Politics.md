Public and policy discourse in India is mostly reactive: after X happens, the debate quickly moves into "we need a policy to tackle X" and "why did we not have a policy to tackle X". If the next outrage cycle does not obliterate public memory of X, then some policy changes are made. The post-tsunami disaster response infrastructure and the post-26/11 internal security processes are cases in point. 

One of the reasons for reactive mode policymaking is Rearview Politics. The priorities are massively directed towards righting the wrongs of the past, solving age-old problems and legacy issues. Since the past is infinite, it is possible to further and further back -- or focus on any particular epoch -- and attempt to set things right now. Identity politics creates incentives for such prioritisation, and as there is a multitude of identities, there will be plenty to set right. There will also be plenty of space to determine which of those past issues merits present attention and how the problems of the past can be fixed today. The political economy of redressing the wrongs of the past is powerful and pervasive. 

This is not to say that some of the past wrongs do not need present redressal. They do. The point is since the Constitution of India embodied [[Social revolution]] it is inevitable that the rearview mirror of Indian politics will become larger over time. 

The opportunity cost of rearview politics is the inability to prepare sufficiently in advance for the future. Few politicians and civil servants have time to address challenges, risks and threats that *might* appear *a few years* from now, for they are preoccupied with the accumulated problems of the past and the present. 

### How do we change this? 
One way is to create "islands of the future" within the Union and state cabinets, and post forward-looking ministers and civil servants to them. NITI Aayog is a good example. I am familiar with IT and Biotech Department in Karnataka that has a forward looking outlook. Chandrababu Naidu's Andhra Pradesh government had put in place a similar department. None of these are as powerful and influential as they ought to be, but they are starting points.
