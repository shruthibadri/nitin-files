## What are the behavioral and social consequences of constant anxiety?

## Crisis and Leviathan
- Bryan Caplan [quotes](https://www.econlib.org/libertys-crisis-crisis/) Richard Higgs (from a 1987 book)
	>[W]e do know something – at least abstractly – about the future.  We know that other great crises will come.  Whether they will be occasioned by foreign wars, economic collapse, or rampant terrorism, no one can predict with assurances.  Yet in one form of another, great crises will surely come again… When they do, governments almost certainly will gain new powers over economic and social affairs… For those who cherish individual liberty and a free society, the prospect is deeply disheartening.

- Caplan [writes](https://www.econlib.org/libertys-crisis-crisis/) that "that the chief problem in each crisis (such as 9/11, Covid-19, etc) has been government’s hysterical overreaction.  Verily, the cure is worse than the disease.  Still, that doesn’t change the fact that the _net_ effect of these crises has been awful."

## Tentative Assessments
- Pervasive anxiety suppresses emotions like compassion and elevates outrage; there is a series of moral panics and a preference for fast track solutions, disregard for due process; this makes populists and demagogues more powerful; they can capture state power.
