## Purpose
This framework aims to allow firms to reopen their office premises and for employees to return to their office workplaces in a free, safe and responsible manner.

## Principles

1. This framework applies until public authorities declare an end to the pandemic.
2. Individuals are best placed to decide on the levels of risk they wish to take. Firms and public authorities must provide them with factual information to enable them to make good decisions. 
3. Firms are required to consider the collective safety of staff, suppliers and visitors. To this end they should disallow, dissuade or discourage behaviours that may put others at risk. 
4. Firms must carry out their business functions which are the reasons why they exist. This should be done while -- to the greatest extent -- respecting individual decisions and collective safety as mentioned above. 
5. There shall be no discrimination between employees who opt to work at the office and those who do not for public health reasons.  

(Note that these are principles, not rules. They imply good faith, good judgement and logical reasoning as the basis of decision-making. )

## Framework 
#### Version 0.92 2021-09-10

### 1. Cleared For Office

Whether or not a person is eligible to enter to the office will be determined by the Cleared For Office Score (CFO Score), where

**Cleared For Office (CFO) Score = Individual Protection Level (IPL) Ã— Epidemic Level (EL)** 
	

| CFO Score      | Indication | Explanation |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| 4 or higher     | Cleared for Office      | No permission required |
| Between 3 and 4 | Conditionally Cleared For Office | Prior permission required | 
| Between 0 and 3 | Not Cleared For Office | Not permitted 
| 0 and IPL is 0 or 4 | Not Cleared For Office | Review Case-by-Case |

### 2. Individual Protection Level

| IPL Score | Meaning |
|---|---|
|0|Unvaccinated or Uninfected or Other Risks |
|1|Partially Vaccinated and Uninfected |
|2|Fully Vaccinated| 
|3|Previously Infected|
|4|Fully Vaccinated and Previously Infected|

### 3. Epidemic Level 

|EL Score | Meaning|
|--|--|
|0| Rampant Spread |
|1| Rising Cases|
|2| Stable But Significant Cases |
|3| Declining Cases |
|4| Stable but Low cases |
	

### 4. Mandatory Safety Protocols
1. No more than 50% of the office capacity should be utilised. Small meeting rooms should be closed. Good ventilation must be ensured at all times. 
2. Mandatory face covering and physical distance of over 1 metre between workstations & seats must be ensured.
3. Mandatory attendance and visitor registration, with prompt notification in case risks are identified.
4. Employees returning from inter-city or inter-state travel are not cleared for office for a period of 3 days after return, regardless of their CFO score. Employees using public transport must take strict safety precautions during commute. 
5. CFO Score applies to all visitors to the office. Where possible, a portion of the office should be seggregated for meeting external visitors.
