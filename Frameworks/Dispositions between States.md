## Proposition
Twenty-seven types of relationship conditions are possible between two states, based on the relative dispositions of their interests, values and resources. 

In this table, we use a balanced ternary system to score convergence in a particular area as 1, divergence as -1 and neutrality as zero. A ternary (base-3) system is sufficient for our analysis. 



| Type | Interests | Values | Resources | Disposition             |
| ------ | --------- | ------ | --------- | ----------------------- |
| 1      | 1         | 1      | 1         | Natural Allies          |

## Comment
- Base nomenclature: 
	- When states converge or diverge in any one area, they are termed partners or rivals respectively. 
	- Where they do so in more than one area they are termed allies or adversaries
	- Questions: 
		- what do we call dispositions where there is convergence in one area, but divergence in at least one other area
			- what do we call dispositions where convergences outnumber divergences
			- where divergences outnumber convergences
			- where there are equal numbers of convergences and divergences 
- Some combinations of the 27 dispositions are perhaps more stable than others.
- Realist hypothesis: Where multiple convergences and divergences, divergences and interests dominate. 
- Power is external to the disposition matrix. The disposition matrix tells us how things are stacked and what options we theoretically have. Relative power determines which of those options we really have and can exercise.
