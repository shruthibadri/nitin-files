One of the most valuable pieces of advice I got while setting up [[Takshashila Institution|Takshashila]] was from Aroon Raman, who told me about Yoshikazu Tsuda's framework. 

## The problem
Tsuda breaks management into three functions: **retainment** (maintaining existing levels of performance), **improvement** (raising quality) and **breakthrough** (innovation of improvement). Indian managers, in his view, spend 90% of their time on retainment, 10% on improvement and zero on breakthrough. 

He [observed that](https://vivifychangecatalyst.wordpress.com/2019/12/26/yoshikazu-tsuda-zhang-ruimin-and-middle-management-part-1/): 
> In most (Indian) companies, managers work like supervisors, but that’s not their job. A manager’s job is to manage. He should spend the maximum amount of his time on improvement and breakthroughs. Operational details are for workers. But here, most managers are busy with the operational details. I believe the Indian worker is doing his job; the Indian manager is not...it is the middle level that is not performing. The production manager works like a jail superintendent. He is too involved with the supervisory role. 

## The solution

As Aroon Raman explained to me, leaders must set goals for themselves and for everyone in the organisation to consciously delegate a certain portion of their "retainment" and "improvement" role every year. This should be part of the performance management system, from target setting to appraisal and reward. 

## Observations
I instituted this approach at Takshashila and (by my own evaluation) we have been fairly successful in this. The biggest challenge is the trade-off between delegation and quality risk. 

In contrast to Tsuda's experience elsewhere, maintaining the existing level of quality is much harder in India. This might be why the middle management problem exists in the first place. A lot of Indian employers have to make up for the education system's (and the overall system's) shortcomings, resulting in disproportionate energy being consumed by retainment level activity. 

As a small, knowledge-economy organisation based in Bangalore, Takshashila has an easier time than larger organisations based in places where good talent is harder to acquire in adequate numbers. 

For the economy as a whole to become more innovative and productive, the system must not impose such hidden costs on employers. A company in Singapore, for instance, can be a lot more competitive because it needs to invest less in equipping junior staff with the required mindset and skills.
