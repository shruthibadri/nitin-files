## Proposition
Nine types of alliances are possible between two states, based on the relative convergences of their interests, values and resources. 

| Convergence of | B's Interests     | B's Values       | B's Resources        |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| **A's Interests**  | ==Tactical Alliance==          | Moral Cover      | Financial Support    |
| **A's Values**     | Moral Cover       | ==Moral Fraternity== | Financial Cover      |
| **A's Resources**  | Financial Support | Financial Cover  | ==Economic Partnership== |

## Comment
- In strict terms, there are only six types of alliances, as there are duplicates. But if we account for directionality in the relationship there are nine types. For instance, receiving and providing Financial Support are two different "types" of relationships from a given state's perspective. 
- The strongest alliance is one where the extent of convergence of interests, values and resources is very high. We can call this a "natural alliance". Such an alliance can endure short-term deviations in any one of the three dimensions, as the other two will hold the relationship together. 
- Which is the weakest? The one where one state provides financial cover for another's value agenda might be the weakest. Second to it is where one state provides financial support for another's pursuit of interests. Such cover can easily be withdrawn. 
- This is a Kautilyan method of analysis and a subset of [[Dispositions between States]]
