## Proposition
The skills needed to acquire power are not the same as the ones required to deliver good governance. Military leaders in historical times and electoral politicians in contemporary times have instincts and skills for acquiring and retaining power. This pursuit is so overwhelming that they have little time and incentive to invest in learning how to govern well. 

## Framework
- Constructing a 2x2 framework on acquiring power and delivering governance
	- the expectation of delivering governance is a recent phenomenon and peculiar to liberal democracies. In the past all that mattered to the ruler was acquiring power. 
	- How can we maximise chances of getting to the fourth quadrant or what can we do if we are in the second or third? 
	- there is a curve above the 45 deg line, growing exponentially after the threshold where office is actually acquired. 
- Representative democracy might never allow us to get to "bitter pill" except in an exceptional crisis, further qualified at times and places where the political leadership has enough governance knowledge (or does not have anti-governance knowledge) 
	- The price of liberty is eternal education #myquote. But can such education arise endogenously?
- Can we create a learn-unlearn framework for a leader who wishes to meet the power-governance demand curve? Four or Five stages in a leader's journey: from seeker to statesman.
