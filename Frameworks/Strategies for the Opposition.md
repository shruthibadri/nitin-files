Political parties in India adopt an "oppose everything" strategy when they are in the Opposition. This is not an effective strategy. 

"Obstructionism is successful as a political strategy only if it is successful." (Yes, it goes around it circles.)

Mostly it locks parties into traps of their own creation making it harder for them to implement necessary and good policies when they come to power. 

This #framework attempts to separate the two dimensions and propose broad strategies for each of the four categories of issues.

## Explanation
Political parties adopt an "oppose everything" strategy because they conflate politically resonant issues with those with policy impact. 

If they separate political issues (concerning values, causes and emotions) with policy matters (concerning rules, procedures, technical changes) they may be more effective, and arguably, electorally successful. 

In other words: don't go around opposing everything and attacking the outrage-of-the-day.
