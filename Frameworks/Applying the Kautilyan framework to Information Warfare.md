#framework 

Kautilya categorises power into three types. This is an attempt to apply the framework in the context of the [[notebook/Information Age]] and while [[notebook/Conceptualising Information Warfare]]

- power of counsel comprising the strength of intellect (intellectual property, algorithms and analytics)

- power of might comprising the strength of treasury and army (knowledge economy and technological capabilities)

- and power of effort comprising the strength of valor (skill in using information for advantage)
