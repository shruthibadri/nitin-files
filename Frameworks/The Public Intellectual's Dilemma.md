A #framework to understand elite public discourse 

![[public-intellectuals-dilemma.png]]

## Proposition
- While everyone would like to enjoy credibility among peers and stay on the right side of power, if a choice has to be made, some public intellectuals tend to sacrifice peer credibility for proximity to power. 
- Corollary: powerful leaders might use this as a loyalty test or entry hurdle, and only accomodate those who have sacrificed their peer credibility.
