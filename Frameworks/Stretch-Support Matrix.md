## The framework
The Stretch-Support Matrix is a tool extensively used by Hema Hattangady, author of [Lift-Off](https://www.amazon.in/Lift-Off-Conzerv-Hema-Hattangady-ebook/dp/B082TTWKG1/), to get a sense of the job satisfaction level of an individual in an organisation's workforce. 

Stretch is the effort and the amount of work a person does, while Support is overall support (infrastructure and mental) that the organisation provides. 

Both Stretch and Support are measured on an ascending scale of ten. In addition,  overall satisfaction can also be measured on a scale of one to ten.

The Stretch-Support Matrix is administered as a simple survey. 

## How to use it
At Takshashila we first adopted it in 2018 and polled the entire staff roughly twice a year. 

Since 2021, in part due to the work-from-home routine, we poll more frequently -- roughly four to six times a year. We do this deliberately out of phase with the performance reviews. 

The Stretch-Support Matrix helps us in the following way:
- Team leaders get a quick sense of individual workloads and satisfaction and take prompt remedial action; sometimes even pre-emptory action.
- Looking at the data over time reveals deeper patterns, allowing for better performance management.
