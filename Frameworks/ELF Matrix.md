## The Framework 
The ELF Matrix is a tool created by Hema Hattangady, author of [Lift-Off](https://www.amazon.in/Lift-Off-Conzerv-Hema-Hattangady-ebook/dp/B082TTWKG1/) to get a sense of the gap between expectations and the actual in the minds of individuals in a organisation's workforce. 

It measures the gap between Emotional, Learning and Financial expectations and actuals. 

On a scale of one to ten, it scores the:
- Emotional bonding that an individual feels with the organisation
- Learning environment that the organisation offers for personal and professional growth
- Financial benefits 
- **Takshashila's fork to ELF**: Institutional value addition: the opportunities the institution provides for personal brand-building and professional growth. 

The ELF Matrix is administered as a simple survey. 

## How to use it
At Takshashila we first adopted it in 2018 and poll the entire staff roughly twice a year. 

The ELF Matrix helps us in the following way:
- by separating emotional, learning, institutional and financial aspects, team leaders get a nuanced view of expectation gaps. 
- allows better human resource planning by tailoring staff development initiatives to address gaps, especially if they are recurring/widening. 
- allows a more holistic view of staff performance, beyond the quarterly performance reviews.
