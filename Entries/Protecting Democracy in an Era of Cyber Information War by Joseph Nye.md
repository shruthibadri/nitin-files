## Main argument
- focuses predominantly on the threat from Russia, and perfunctorily to China. But casts the contest as between authoritarian states and democracies. 
- distinguishes soft power and sharp power. Soft power is open, truthful and aims to attract and persuade people voluntarily. Sharp power goes beyond this into coercion and often relies on deception. (See [[Published Notes/Entries/Operation INFEKTION]])
- soft power and sharp power are not compatible. Sharp power undermines soft power. 
- openness is a strength for democracies and a weakness for authoritarian states 
- authoritarian states see openness as information warfare directed against them
- allowing adversaries to develop soft power (openly and transparently) is beneficial and help build bridges; but sharp power must be countered.
- Recommended strategy for the United States
	- domestic resilience 
	- deterrence: using threat of punishment, by defence, entanglement and normative taboos.
	- diplomacy: arms control; limit behavior, not possession
