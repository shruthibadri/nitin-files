## Definition
Alex Tabarrok defines a "flowpile" as opposed to a "stockpile"
>The government wouldn’t store anything but would instead pay firms to increase their inventories with production going into the inventory and sales coming out. A flowpile doesn’t need periodic restocking or reauthorization, and once the system starts, firms have an incentive to lobby to keep it going. Want to produce a public good? Tie it to some pork.
