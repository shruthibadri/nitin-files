# Long-termism

The idea that we have a moral responsibility for the well-being of humanity thousands and millions of years from now. 

My the fundamental criticism is that long-termism is anthropocentric conceit; that humanity matters in the big scheme of things. From religions to moral philosophers, there is an explicit dogma or implicit assumption that human survival in the universe matters (for anyone/anything other than the humans themselves). It doesn't. No one will miss us. It is doubtful if we should care beyond a point...although we can debate how far that point ought to be. Of course, biodiversity will change, but the order of nature means that the ecosystem will adapt to our absence.

My response to unforeseeable long-termism is [[Foreseeable sustainability]].
