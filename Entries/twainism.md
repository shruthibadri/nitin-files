*twainism, noun*
: The word I coined for the feeling you get the moment you realise what you thought was your brilliant original idea was already expressed by some smart person (usually Mark Twain) in the past. 
If Archimedes had a twainism he would jump right back into the tub after banging his head against the wall. 
I am awaiting the moment when I find out that Mark Twain had already coined a word for the same feeling.
