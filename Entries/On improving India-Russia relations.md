### Remarks at a India-Russia think tank conference on 2022-01-28
1. Russia, and previously the Soviet Union, is a country with who we have always been on good terms with. So we can speak as friends. 
2. I have no new point to make: only to stress [a point I've always been making](https://theprint.in/opinion/an-insider-look-into-what-russia-actually-thinks-of-india/165344/) and argue that it has become more important.
3. **The fundamental problem in bilateral relations is that it is concentrated in a few strategic sectors -- defence, energy, commodities -- that do not involve large scale people-to-people contacts.** They are also government-driven. This limits each country's perception of value to the other. 
4. How do we get out of this situation? **We must diversify the economic relationship and make it broad and deep**. However this is not easy, as trade will follow comparative advantage. There are also deep existing trading relationships that each country has, making it difficult to diversify unless there is a significant competitive advantage to do so. 
5. **The other way is to focus on industries of tomorrow, where such relationships do not already exist.** This is the importance of the technology and innovation sector. Despite tensions with China we have large numbers of Chinese investors and entrepreneurs engaged with their Indian counterparts. Trade with China increased despite border tensions. There is something to learn from this.
6. Why is this the case? It is because the Chinese and Indian tech eco-systems are **interconnected through the global economic system**. There are no barriers to flows of goods, money, ideas and people. Despite the retreat of globalisation, despite border tensions, despite the US-China trade war, the relationship is strengthening. 
7. When tensions recede, there is a strong engine for building a relationship. In fact, the relationship itself can somewhat manage the tensions. 
8. So I invite our Russian counterparts to reflect on this: how can Russian investors, technologists, entrepreneurs connect with India? **How do we build the Skolkovo-Bangalore connection?** To the extent that we have more people from Moscow, Skolkovo and St Peterburg engaged in Bengaluru, and more people from this city hanging out in Skolkovo, India-Russia relations will be stronger, balanced and more resilient. 
	- Strong bilateral relations happen when both sides are engaged in global economic networks & eco-systems.
