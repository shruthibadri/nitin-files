## Why did the Afghan Army collapse in 2020-21

### Question
The Najibullah government remained in power for two years after the Soviet withdrawal in 1989 and for several months after the collapse of the USSR in 1991.

Why did Ashraf Ghani's government fall so precipitously and even before US troops had left? 

 
### Explanations 

Donald Trump's February 2020 deal with the Taliban in Doha precipitated the collapse of the Afghan National Army by
- conceding to the Taliban that come what may, the United States would leave Afghanistan in 14 months. 
- thus eroding the morale of the Afghan National Army 
- US stopped logistics, technical and military backup impairing the ability to fight
- unpaid soldiers and in some instances deals between commanders lubricated the process
- Issues of morale and legitimacy identified by [[Carter Malkasian on why the US failed in Afghanistan]] may well be true as underlying causes, not precipitate ones. 

#### Defence policy, military organisation and force structure
[According to Gautam Mukhopadhyay](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-what-kabul-means-in-delhi-7455479/) (2021-08) the Afghan national army was "invested just enough for the war on terror, but not the defence of Afghanistan." It was trained and equipped for counter-terrorism and not for national defence. 

#### Washington's botched implementation of the withdrawal 
[From Lt Gen Sami Sadat](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/25/opinion/afghanistan-taliban-army.html) (2021-08) of the Afghan National Army:

> First, former President Donald Trump’s in Doha doomed us. It put an expiration date on American interest in the region. 
> Second, we lost contractor logistics and maintenance support critical to our combat operations. 
> Third, endemic in Mr. Ghani’s government that flowed to senior military leadership and long crippled our forces on the ground irreparably hobbled us.  

It could well be this act by the United States that precipitated the collapse. Gen Sadat is not wrong to consider his troops betrayed.

>Contractors maintained our bombers and our attack and transport aircraft throughout the war. By July, most of the 17,000 support contractors had left. A technical issue now meant that aircraft — a Black Hawk helicopter, a C-130 transport, a surveillance drone — would be grounded.
>The contractors also took proprietary software and weapons systems with them. They physically removed our helicopter missile-defense system. Access to the software that we relied on to track our vehicles, weapons and personnel also disappeared. Real-time intelligence on targets went out the window, too.
>The Taliban fought with snipers and improvised explosive devices while we lost aerial and laser-guided weapon capacity. And since we could not resupply bases without helicopter support, soldiers often lacked the necessary tools to fight. The Taliban overran many bases; in other places, entire units surrendered.

Gautam Mukhopadhyaya [concurs](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-what-kabul-means-in-delhi-7455479/) with this view.
>Technical dependence on the US for air support, weapon systems, intelligence etc, psychological denial that they would indeed leave as they warned, a lack of military strategy, poor supplies and logistics, indefensible and thinly manned posts, unpaid salaries, phantom rolls, and a sense of betrayal, abandonment and demoralisation, all played a role in this. 

Emile Simpson (British army officer) [agrees](https://www.ft.com/content/5a35e66f-ccf1-4625-a248-3c425b77a4e8)
>True, the Afghan army ultimately collapsed. But this was not fundamentally a case of a lack of willingness to fight. Rather, the army had already been badly depleted by casualties. With the exception of its special forces, its morale plummeted when western logistical and military back-up was suddenly withdrawn, leaving forces spread widely, isolated and unable to move casualties out and supplies forward.

#### Moral Legitimacy & Motivation 
The Afghan National Army was less inspired to fight as its troops had relatively weaker convictions about their moral legitimacy; as explained (in 2021) by [[Carter Malkasian on why the US failed in Afghanistan]]. "The Taliban had an edge in inspiration. That edge made a difference."
