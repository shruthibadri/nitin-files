>The idea that future people count is common sense. Future people, after all, are people. They will exist. They will have hopes and joys and pains and regrets, just like the rest of us. They just don’t exist yet.

This can be challenged. Time counts. While a bottle that you leave in the woods might hurt a kid tomorrow, there's a smaller chance that it'll hurt someone 100 years hence. Future people are identical to current people only if we discount the effect of time. How do we account for time? How can we be certain that it will degrade future lives? What degree of certainty do we need to sacrifice current well-being? 

Metaphors: humanity is like an imprudent teenager, there are moments of plasticity/malleability (glass blowing), and we are on a risky expedition

>Distance in time is like distance in space. People matter even if they live thousands of miles away.

This glosses over a crucial distinction: people on another continent are real; people in another century are potentially real. If a meteor destroys us tomorrow, those future people will not exist. Hence the sacrifices you made for them are wasted. 

MacAskill: two reasons why we care more for present generations: partiality (we know them) and reciprocity (they benefit us). These ignore the most important reason: they are real! 

>This matters, because the number of future people could be huge...Population size could get dramatically larger again if we one day take to the stars.

Not necessarily. It could be very small due to an act of nature (meteor strike, plate tectonics). We don't know. MacAskill's analysis is linear and deterministic. 

>if we truly care about the interests of future generations—if we recognize that they are real people, capable of happiness and suffering just like us—then we have a duty to consider how we might impact the world they inhabit.

To the extent future people are real, we have a duty...and only to the extent. 

>But the future is so important that we’ve got to at least try to figure out how to steer it in a positive direction. And, already, there are some things we can say.

Steering is an ambitious word and perhaps foolish given the complexity of life. Kicking the ball down the road, or setting the stage for a better tomorrow, might be a more effective goal. If the test of long-termism is effectiveness, then it has to show why it is more effective than [[foreseeable sustainability]]. 

Ek din bik jayega maati ke mol/jag mein reh jayenge pyaare tere bol
Doojhe ke honton ko deke apne geet/ Koi nishani chhod, phir duniya se dol. (Majrooh Sultanpuri)

>Decarbonisation is a proof of concept for longtermism.

It's too early to tell. We do not know the costs and consequences of decarbonisation. [[Foreseeable sustainability]] indicates decarbonisation; it will also allow for changes if we want. 

MacAskill: current moment is unique, because we are empowered to change the course of the future.

This is the strongest of his claims; but even so, it too is hubris. Hubris is not only of the positive kind, seeing human actions as powerful enough to create a desired future; it is also of the negative kind, seeing human actions as so consequential to the future. 

MacAskill's #framework for determining long-term value: significance X persistence X contingency
- two main ways we influence the long-term: we affect humanity's duration & we can change trajectory
  
Use of Expected Value function to make decisions:
- indicates [[foreseeable sustainability]] more than long-termism; because if we believe in emergence, the likelihood of getting the probabilities wrong (and possible outcomes incomplete) is higher in the latter case. In other words, expected value is accurate in the shorter-term

Blowing glass: early plasticity, later rigidity. We must make the most of such moments. 

Changing trajectory:
- changing society's values 
- MacAskill offers good arguments on why moral values of society are highly contingent

>We are very far from creating the perfect society, and until then, in order to drive forward moral progress, we need morally motivated heretics who are able to endure ridicule from those who wish to preserve the status quo.
>Revolutionary beliefs; cooperative behaviour.

Long-termists got pandemic preparation right

Long-termists see a need to prevent great power war: but this is a "trivial" argument, and is justified on several bases: immediate term, mid-term etc. While long-termism weighs in against war, we would not miss this insight even if there were no long-termism. (So too pandemics, planetary defence etc).

>We therefore cannot be confident that, were human civilisation to end, some other technologically capable species would eventually take our place. And even if you think that there is a 90 percent chance that this would happen, that would only reduce the risk that a major catastrophe would bring about the permanent end of civilisation by a factor of ten: the risk would still be more than great enough that reducing it should be a pressing moral priority.
>Moreover, if some step in our evolutionary history was extremely improbable, there might be no other highly intelligent life elsewhere in the affectable universe, and there might never be. If this is true, then our actions are of cosmic significance.

This is back to the anthropocentric conceit: that humanity and its actions matter for anyone/anything in the Universe other than humanity itself. The moral judgement is self-serving...we think survival of humanity is a good thing because it serves our interests; there is no external reason to accept this argument. Celestial bodies don't care, neither to alien civilisations that are so distant as to be out of range of communications. 

>Parfit concluded that preventing the existence of a happy and flourishing life is a moral loss; the loss from human extinction is therefore vast. In later work, he concluded that “what now matters most is that we avoid ending human history.”

We can agree with Parfit to the extent that we look at opportunity costs. Preventing nuclear annihilation to preserve humanity is quite different from subjecting hundreds of millions of existing people, without their consent (which is what public policy is!), to lower living standards in order to support future generations. (MacAskill says 10% of the global population lives below-neutral wellbeing)

> If future people will be sufficiently well-off, then a civilisation that is twice as long or twice as large is twice as good.
> The practical upshot of this is a moral case for space settlement. Though Earth-based civilisation could last for hundreds of millions of years, the stars will still be shining in trillions of years’ time, and a civilisation that is spread out across many solar systems could last at least this long.

Anthropomorphic conceit again: the morality of human flourishing applies only to humans; the Universe doesn't care. In fact, to the extent that human flourishing comes at the cost of other living organisms, especially sentient ones, we can argue that human flourishing is a "bad". MacAskill admits this possibility especially with respect to farmed animals..but also concludes that since wild animals live "worse than nothing on average" it is plausible to say human activity has been a good thing! 

In the chapter on stagnation, MacAskill persuades us on how stagnation can create greater risks for long-term survival by accelerating collapse. Indeed, these are the very reasons to be careful about pushing long-termism: the present opportunity costs of long-termism might precipitate collapse in the same way as stagnation does. 

How to select a problem to solve (fund): tractability and neglectedness. This is a good framework. 

>longtermism as a supplement to commonsense morality, not a replacement for it.

The good thing about [[Long-termism]] is that it teaches us the importance of patiently working toward causes that bear fruit in the long-term, seemingly hopeless and lonely.
