## An alternative to [[long-termism]]
- do the best you can for the present and the foreseeable future
- sustainability means you leave behind more than what you found (and consumed)
- this is perhaps a better meaning of the Iroquois consideration for the seventh generation; rather than a concern for a unrelated future person 
- path dependence is a factor of complex systems: near-term hurdles have a disproportionate impact on the kind of futures available to us. A war that wipes out several ethnic groups on a continent, for instance, removes that many genes from shaping the future; reducing the cone of possibilities.
