## Molten Salt Reactors
[China Says It's Closing in on Thorium Nuclear Reactor](https://spectrum.ieee.org/china-closing-in-on-thorium-nuclear-reactor) and [China prepares to test thorium-fuelled nuclear reactor](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02459-w) 
- China is testing a Molten Salt Reactor; based on Oak Ridge designs that are publicly available
- India's current designs are AHWR (advanced heavy water) although MSR designs are being 'validated'. The sense is that MSRs will be the choice of design; although the timelines offered are 2050 
- When Thorium is radiated with neutrons in a reactor, it transforms into U-233, which is fissile. The heat from its fission is used to generate electricity. 
- Indian plan is to place blankets of Thorium around fast-breeder reactor cores (that use Plutonium Oxide-Uranium Oxide mix) to obtain U-233  
- Molten Salt Reactors are considered:
	- safer, operate near atmospheric pressure, unlike PHWR; fuel is dissolved in liquid salt
	- more efficient, as they operate at higher temperatures
