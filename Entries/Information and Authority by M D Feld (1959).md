## Reference
Feld, M. (1959). Information and Authority: The Structure of Military Organization. _American Sociological Review,_ _24_(1), 15-22. doi:10.2307/2089578

## Argument
- Military organisations distinguish
	- those with experience of combat -  front
	- those with understanding of combat -  rear
- They also place higher value on exercise of reason than on acquisition of experience #hmm
	- those capable of reason - given authority - need calm, detachment
	- those with experience - subordinate - operate in confusion and involvement
- planning is thus different from its execution
- status structure has greater weight in decision-making

## Notes
- US Field Manual distinguishes leadership (personally acquired authority) and command (formally delegated authority); ideally they must be harmonised.
- Military organisations have two distinct semi-autonomous organisations: concerned with strategy and tactics respectively; competence in one aspect has no necessary relation to competence in the other
- Quote
>In what is perhaps the most perceptive of all combat studies of World War II, S. L. A. Marshall gives a command analysis by the leader of a highly successful company action. 
		>In any such desperateaction as a charge, it is necessary to have an officerboldlyleading. But it is not less important to have one forceful individualremain behind to do the pushing.... 
		>I gave myself the task of remaining behind and prodding them because I am the commander. It was my plan and I had given the order. It was my duty to see that it was carried out. I consideredthat my post should be at the point which offered the best chance of bringing off a successful and completed action.7 
>In other words, this division of labor involves the cultivation of an appropriatepoint of view. In a literal sense, the commander and the leader each operate from a different position. '
- Command responsibilities are pushed to the rear because they need calm detachment that is not possible in front
- In Feld's view the two boxes are 
	- Branch 1 - Reasoning-Command-Strategy-Planning-Rear
	- Branch 2 - Experience-Leadership-Tactical-Execution-Front
	- But Branch 1 is usually hierarchically superior to Branch 2
- Informationally the two branches are incomprehensible
	- staff information is esoteric; line information is trivial 
- "For authority to be meaningful, it is only necessary that a superior officer know relatively more" 
	- hierarchy empowers those higher up because they have many branches reporting to them; #insight 
	- superior officer expects truthful reports; subordinates expect rationality in the orders they get
	- apportioning knowledge to rank is thus a control mechanism; especially in confusion
	- asserting rank conflates asserting knowledge and assering authority
	- secluding the command posts to the rear protects authority 
- Ergo, in Feld's view, hierarchy is valuable to the functioning of a military organisation. 
	- conversely "provision of information (laterally) might be regarded as an acknowledgement of subordination"
- Access to information takes precedence over formal rank in determining organisational status 

## Concluding paragraph
>In terms of this same organizational structure, planning, exercise of reason, and rearward position result in high military authority. Execution, dependence upon direct personal experience,and frontal position, on the other hand, result in low military authority. The dictates of reason as exercised in the rear are, therefore, of greater weight than the facts of experience as suffered in the front. ==A plan of operations once decided must therefore be carried out even if reports from the scene of combat indicate that it is unrealistic.== Determination of this kind is regarded as essential if the military structure of rank and authority is to be preserved.
