## Prepared in 2018

I’d probably give you different books depending on when you ask me. Let me list some that would make it the top five most of the time:

1. Morgenthau’s "Politics Among Nations" is a very influential work on realism in international relations that I think is a necessary reading for anyone who has a real interest in the subject.
2. Francis Fukuyama’s "The Origins of Political Order" has now become an indispensable part of the international relations bookshelf. 
3. There are many translations of the Arthashastra, and I would put R P Kangle’s old translation & commentary; and Patrick Olivelle’s more recent translation in my bookshelf.
4. John Bew’s "Realpolitik: traces the history of the idea of international relations in the era of modern nation-states. 
5. K M Panikkar’s books are unfortunately out of print - but his two books “India in the Indian Ocean” and “Geographical Factors in Indian History” offer insights into India’s engagement with the world that are seldom found in other accounts.
