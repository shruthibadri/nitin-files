## Military Organisation
Two kinds: natural (in tribal and primitive societies) and artificial (specialised arm of the state)
### History
- Artificial military system of the Roman Empire was replaced by the natural system of the barbarian hordes; this developed into the Feudal system 
	- tenure of land on condition of liability of military service; service was owed upwards, tenure and security downwards
	- feudal lords assembled their own troops (feudal levies) when called upon; also employed mercenaries who were the only professional soldiers; or militant religious orders 
	- Advent of gunpowder in 14thC restored to infantry the primary role, which had been lost to cavalry during feudal period
	- Also 14th century; Turkish Janissaries were proto-standing armies 
	- 15thC - France and England formed companies and regiments that were along this pattern; France and others formed standing armies; Britain did so only in 1660 (after the Civil War) if we don't count Cromwell's model army.
- The company was the administrative unit; infantry company had pike-men & musketeers in 3:1 or 2:1 ratio. 
	- tactically, the pikemen of several companies assembled into squares called "battalia"; with musketeers on the flank.
	- ten or more companies were assembled into a "regiment" or military government, to better coordinate and administer
		- a senior captain commanded this; title was "colonello" or column commander.  
		- staff duties were assigned to other captains: scout-master, quarter-master, baggage-master etc
		- a special company called "forlorn hope" ("enfants perdus") with greater strength was commanded by the colonel's deputy, a lieutenant-colonel.
		- regiments raised troops, not companies. 
		- Commissions were purchased, and investments recouped through allowances 
		- A certain number of "straw men" were included in the rolls to minimise falsification of muster-rolls. 
		- Colonel of the Regiment was an absentee general officer, the CO being a Lt Col
- Artillery was looked upon as a civil, non-combatant arm
- Captains were higher than Majors, who were staff officers and adjutants (army ranks and regimental ranks would be different); end-19thC, majors outranked captains
	- promotions were decided at company level up to the mid-18th century; later at regimental level
- Regiments became large and unwieldy; with as many as 20 companies. They were divided into battalions which became the tactical unit of infantry. 
	- on parade, the battalions were divided into platoons of equal strength, regardless of company
	- the grenadier company was detached from its own battalion; and grenadier companies would be assembled into provisional battalions during a campaign. Grenadiers were paid better and officers drawn from across the regiment.
- =="continual and rightful tendency to assimilate the tactical and administrative unit, which is a guiding principle of modern military administration."== 
- Cavalry 'companies', called 'troops' were assembled into regiments. Two troops formed a squadron, the tactical unit of cavalry.
- Dragoons were mounted musketeers, often repurposed into cavalry
- "Horse, Foot and Dragoons were the three arms of the Service. Artillery and Engineers were reckoned as non-combatants and for long had no organisation." Artillery regiment (beginning 18thC), Royal Engineers (beginning 19thC)
- Regiment - highest unit of organisatio during peacetime. In war, army was divided into main body, left & right wings and reserve. 
- Growing size of army and spread over an extended line led to the assembly of regiments in brigades; and brigades into divisions before campaign. Dissolved after war.
- Carnot (War Minister of the French Republic) reorganised the armed forces
- Napoleon created Corps to better organise command; most European armies (save British) copied the Carnot-Napoleon model. (4 cavalry sqns or 4 infantry bns per regiment)
	- incorporated supply & transport into military organisation
	- had special forces in each formation from battalion level
	- early separation of staff (colonels of regiment) and command (marshals, generals of division and brigade) 
- Short service was invented by Prussians to side-step manpower caps imposed by the victorious Napoleon
- Prussian conscription caused others to copy, and strength grew from 100s of Ks, to to millions
	- conscription territorialised the army, and military districts came into being
	- regiment was the lowest unit that could go into battle 
	- from "standing army" to "national army" or nation-in-arms
