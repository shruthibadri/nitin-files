## Arguments
- technologies: rifle, railway and telegraph
- The industrial revolution was also an information revolution
	- early industrial RMA due to railways and breech-loading rifle: led to revolutionary increases in lethality, accuracy, speed and reach
		- rifle: accuracy and range; transformed tactics
		- railway: force, time and space (6-10x faster); transformed operations and strategy
	- who is the best adapter?

### Key point
>Knowing how to use the machines, and having the capabilities to use them, required and engendered an information revolution. This revolution occurred across three dimensions: ==conceptual, organizational and technological==...In concept, organization and technology, information was indispensable to the RMA. Without conceptual breakthroughs, organization management innovations and information technologies, the railroads and riﬂes of the nineteenth century could not have sparked a revolution in warfare. They would have remained pieces of iron, steel and wood.
- Moltke's innovation in using railways:
	- three large vulnerabilities in the doctrine – ==timing, coordination and capacity== – that needed cultural and organizational transformations to overcome.
	- cultural transformations
	> - the ofﬁcer class had to reconstruct its self-image from dashing and brave warrior to soldier as technician, bureaucrat and engineer;
	> - the planning apparatus of the military had to be more extensive and technical in its orientation and expertise; and
	> - the activities of the military had to be meshed with civilian activities even during peacetime – on a much greater scale and scope than ever before.
- In a footnote
	>Dennis Showalter provides one exception: the Prussian army under Moltke did not pursue the development of ﬁeld telegraphs as vigorously as they might have. He was concerned that the direct communications link to the ﬁeld would tempt him to intervene too much in operations and thereby sap his ﬁeld ofﬁcers of their independence and initiative. Dennis E. Showalter, ‘Soldiers into Postmasters? The Electric Telegraph as an Instrument of Command in the Prussian Army’, Military Affairs 37/2 (April 1973) pp.48–52.
- Britain wanted an "all-red telegraph system" connecting its empire without touching non-British soil. (cff P.M. Kennedy, ‘Imperial Cable Communications and Strategy, 1870–1914’, English Historical Review 86/ 341 (Oct. 1971) p.251.)
	- this went against the interest if private telegraph companies
	- Britain never achieved it, but had a near monopoly
	- In Fashoda Crisis of 1898, Kitchener used the monopoly over telegraph for Britain to achieve negotiation advantage over France, whose troops in Sudan didn't have direct communications.

## Concluding paragraph
>Those militaries that took best advantage of the new technologies of the industrial age were not those that acquired the machines or weapons ﬁrst, but those that recognized the broader informational implications and strove to organize themselves accordingly.
