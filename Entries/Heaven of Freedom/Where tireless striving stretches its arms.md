#### ...towards perfection

It is not good enough to be good enough.

We stop celebrating jugaad, we must be against chalta hai.

We in India make hundreds of very passionate arguments against the quest for excellence, some of these arguments may be legitimate.

A state of affairs that politicians are only too happy to encourage by rolling out quotas, imposing tariffs, giving subsidies and entitlements

A state of affairs that incumbent businessmen are only too happy to encourage by demanding protection against “cheap foreign goods”

A state of affairs where people can invoke Nationalism to accept lower quality goods, because they are made within our political boundaries.

Yet it is also true that we cannot succeed if we remain a nation of shoddy quality poor and work ethics;

#### What I tell my children
My wife “encourages” the children to work hard. And I teach my children some very simple principles: Be punctual. Be precise. Use the right tool for the right purpose and aim to do the Best job, whatever is the job given to you.

## The whole poem
[[Published Notes/Entries/Heaven of Freedom/Where the mind is without fear]] and the head is held high;
[[Where knowledge is free]];
[[Where the world has not been broken]] up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;
[[Where words come out from the depth of truth]];
[[Where tireless striving stretches its arms]] towards perfection;
[[Where the clear stream of reason]]has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;
[[Where the mind is led forward]] by thee into ever-widening thought and action—
[[Into that heaven of freedom]], my Father, let my country awake.
