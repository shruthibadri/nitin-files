Fear from what? From those who want to deprive us of our freedom to think, to speak, to be individuals.

Who wants to deprive us of our freedoms? At different times: foreign invaders, the government, society at large, our local community, our employers and even our own families.

Now civilisation is constructed on us voluntarily trading off some of our freedom for order and rule-of-law, but we must zealously guard our freedoms.

#### Why should the head be held high?

Because we possess dignity, not because of our identity. Not because we are proud of others’s achievements, whether in the ancient past, whether in the present, or the promised future. But because we possess the dignity of being free citizens of a free country.

Freedom gives us the dignity that makes us all equals, where we do not have to be afraid to draw water from a village well, to apply for any job, or walk into a fancy mall, merely because of the parents we chose to have.

This is a good reason to hold our heads high -- because we enjoy freedom and dignity. And not because we belong to some large group of human beings which we happen to belong to just because we were born into it.

#### What I tell my children

That the Indian Republic afﬁrms our liberty and enjoins us to safeguard it, that we should use “Constitutional Methods” to redress our grievances, not the “[[Grammar of Anarchy]]” as [[B R Ambedkar]] warned us.

I tell my daughters that they can be soldiers, pilots, engineers or whatever they choose to be.

I tell my son he can be a great cook.

I tell them they can speak and write whatever they like.

I support them when the “outside system” sometimes tells them otherwise.

I tell them we are second to none, and better than none… Our success, wealth and social status comes from what we make of it.

I tell them we should uphold our dignity and never do anything that will damage other people’s dignity.

## The whole poem
[[Published Notes/Entries/Heaven of Freedom/Where the mind is without fear]] and the head is held high;
[[Where knowledge is free]];
[[Where the world has not been broken]] up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;
[[Where words come out from the depth of truth]];
[[Where tireless striving stretches its arms]] towards perfection;
[[Where the clear stream of reason]]has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;
[[Where the mind is led forward]] by thee into ever-widening thought and action—
[[Into that heaven of freedom]], my Father, let my country awake.
