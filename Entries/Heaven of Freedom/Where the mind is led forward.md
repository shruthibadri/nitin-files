#### ...by thee Into everwidening thought and action

We can be much bigger than our current situation suggests. We *are* much bigger than our current situation suggests.

India was poor when it gave shelter to Tibetan refugees. India was poor when it went to war with Pakistan to stop a genocide. India was poor when it protected democracy in the Maldives and Tamils in Sri Lanka.India was not rich when it conducted the ﬁrst and second nuclear tests.

India is bigger than what the popular narrative suggests.

We complain against bullet trains saying we don’t need them. But India was poor when we invested in building aircrafts, rockets, satellites and nuclear reactors.

We complain about "Western culture and education” but many Indians are at the forefront of culture & science in the United States & Europe. As Tagore said “[[Where knowledge is free]]”. East and West are artiﬁcial.

We are the world’s biggest English speaking country. If there can be an American English, an Australian English, why not an Indian English?

#### What I tell my children
I tell my children to be open-minded, to be broadminded. Do not be mean. Be generous. Be gracious. Have empathy. ==Do not reject ideas just because they come from an unfamiliar direction.== 

## The whole poem
[[Published Notes/Entries/Heaven of Freedom/Where the mind is without fear]] and the head is held high;
[[Where knowledge is free]];
[[Where the world has not been broken]] up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;
[[Where words come out from the depth of truth]];
[[Where tireless striving stretches its arms]] towards perfection;
[[Where the clear stream of reason]]has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;
[[Where the mind is led forward]] by thee into ever-widening thought and action—
[[Into that heaven of freedom]], my Father, let my country awake.
