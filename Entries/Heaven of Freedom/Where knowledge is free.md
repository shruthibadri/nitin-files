Here ”free” means “unconstrained”. Not free of cost.

Where knowledge is unconstrained, where there are no restrictions on the spread of knowledge. It is unlikely that he meant that “all education should be free”. Or worse, that “all education should be not-for-proﬁt”.

The spread of knowledge is now constrained by entrance examinations. Neither is this education nor is it “nonproﬁt”.

When I went to school we would pay less attention to history, geography and language and focus on science and maths. Now people don’t pay attention to the board exams at all, instead “prepare for JEE” or “prepare for UPSC”

#### What I tell my children
We must not be limited by exams, especially entrance exams. My wife agrees, but insists that they get good grades in all their exams. 

## The whole poem
[[Published Notes/Entries/Heaven of Freedom/Where the mind is without fear]] and the head is held high;
[[Where knowledge is free]];
[[Where the world has not been broken]] up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;
[[Where words come out from the depth of truth]];
[[Where tireless striving stretches its arms]] towards perfection;
[[Where the clear stream of reason]]has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;
[[Where the mind is led forward]] by thee into ever-widening thought and action—
[[Into that heaven of freedom]], my Father, let my country awake.
