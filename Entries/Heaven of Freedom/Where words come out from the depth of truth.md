#### What I tell my children
Obviously, I tell my children that they must be honest and truthful. I am honest with them and expect them to be honest with me. I am okay if they do not get good marks as long as they are honest.

But I also teach them to discern the truth to ﬁnd out when someone is lying to them; how to spot fake information.

I teach them how to search for facts on the internet; not to forward WhatsApp messages mindlessly.

I think this is one of my most important duties as a parent.

## The whole poem
[[Published Notes/Entries/Heaven of Freedom/Where the mind is without fear]] and the head is held high;
[[Where knowledge is free]];
[[Where the world has not been broken]] up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;
[[Where words come out from the depth of truth]];
[[Where tireless striving stretches its arms]] towards perfection;
[[Where the clear stream of reason]]has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;
[[Where the mind is led forward]] by thee into ever-widening thought and action—
[[Into that heaven of freedom]], my Father, let my country awake.
