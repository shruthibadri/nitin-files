#### ...my Father, let my country awake.

Who is the Father that will take us into the heaven of freedom; or “with pitiless blows” will take us there?

Tagore was a Brahmo. He might have imagined an abstract “Brahman” that will guide us. But we cannot rely on an abstract supernatural “Father”.

The real Bharata Bhagya Vidhaata is us. Janata Janardhan. And Yatha Praja, Tatha Raja.

That politician is one of us. That judge is one of us. That policeman is one of us. That general is one of us. That social activist is one of us. That person who does not stand in queue is one of us. We are all cut from the same cloth.

To expect a supernatural Father to help us would be to abdicate our responsibility. It will never reward Tagore’s prayer. We have to do it ourselves.

We are the masters of our own destiny. Of our own fate.

#### What I tell my children

So I say to them: Into that heaven of freedom, My Children, let my country awake.

Into that heaven of freedom, My Children, let my country awake. *You* have to awaken my country.

[[Published Notes/Entries/Heaven of Freedom/Where the mind is without fear]] and the head is held high;
[[Where knowledge is free]];
[[Where the world has not been broken]] up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;
[[Where words come out from the depth of truth]];
[[Where tireless striving stretches its arms]] towards perfection;
[[Where the clear stream of reason]]has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;
[[Where the mind is led forward]] by thee into ever-widening thought and action—
[[Into that heaven of freedom]], my Father, let my country awake.
