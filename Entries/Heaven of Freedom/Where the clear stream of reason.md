#### ...has not lost its way Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit

On 26th January 1950, the Enlightenment was injected into the veins of Indian society in the form of a written statute. We are still dealing with the shock of that moment. What took Europe 400 years we in India attempted to do almost overnight.

The Constitution can uphold high principles, and the Supreme Court can safeguard them, but whether or not reason prevails depends on us. On individuals, communities and societies. It’s a democracy.

If people want to be constrained by tradition, culture and superstition, there’s little that the State can do…and indeed it should do little.

The job of upholding reason and rational thinking is that of the individual.

In fact, other than Reason, there is no other basis for social life in India.

We have so much diversity that traditions will clash, cultures will be in conﬂict, and even superstitions contradict each other. Only Reason provides a common language for us to conduct our affairs together.

#### What I tell my children
The starting point is to teach our children to question: from the time they went to kindergarten, I have taught them to question us parents, to question their teachers, to question the “moral of the story” and of course question why things are the way they are.

We cannot accept the dictum “you must listen to him because he is your grandfather”, because grandfathers can be wrong; We cannot accept the advice “You must listen to him because he’s a religious leader” because religious leaders can be wrong,

“Because it’s in our culture”, because culture changes with the times.

Whatever our religious belief, we must never tell our children, “you must do this or else God will punish you”, because that imprisons the child’s mind before it has fully learned how to think.

This, as I’m sure you’ll agree, is very difﬁcult. Family members, neighbours and teachers do not often take kindly to being questioned. They also sometimes cannot give proper answers, which makes them even more upset. At your child, and, at You.

I support my children at such times. I teach them ==to question without being rude or disrespectful, not be arrogant and to accept that some people will be upset by them.== 

## The whole poem
[[Published Notes/Entries/Heaven of Freedom/Where the mind is without fear]] and the head is held high;
[[Where knowledge is free]];
[[Where the world has not been broken]] up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;
[[Where words come out from the depth of truth]];
[[Where tireless striving stretches its arms]] towards perfection;
[[Where the clear stream of reason]]has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;
[[Where the mind is led forward]] by thee into ever-widening thought and action—
[[Into that heaven of freedom]], my Father, let my country awake.
