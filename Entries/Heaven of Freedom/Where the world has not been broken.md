#### Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls

Tagore pleads against parochialism. This is not an argument against political boundaries per se — rather it is an argument against converting political boundaries into mental boundaries, and vice versa.

Political boundaries are helpful for administrative purposes, but they divide humanity, they divide Indians if we see them as mental boundaries. We become smaller individuals, we become smaller communities and we become a smaller civilisation.

#### What I tell my children
Children! I say, invoking The Eagles's Hotel California… “we are are all prisoners here of our own device.”

==Do not imprisoned by the narratives that society has created for us, or even that we have created for ourselves.== 

## The whole poem
[[Published Notes/Entries/Heaven of Freedom/Where the mind is without fear]] and the head is held high;
[[Where knowledge is free]];
[[Where the world has not been broken]] up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;
[[Where words come out from the depth of truth]];
[[Where tireless striving stretches its arms]] towards perfection;
[[Where the clear stream of reason]]has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;
[[Where the mind is led forward]] by thee into ever-widening thought and action—
[[Into that heaven of freedom]], my Father, let my country awake.
