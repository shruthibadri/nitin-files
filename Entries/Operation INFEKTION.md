## Details
In 1983, the KGB planted an article in "the Indian newspaper *Patriot* which itself was a KGB front created in 1967. Its purported author was presented as a "well -known American scientist and anthropologist." It was given academic validation by another article in which two East Germans posed as French scientists and confirmed the findings in the fake article by the fake author. This subsequent article was the subject of no less than forty reports in Soviet newspapers, magazines, radio and television broadcasts. At this point, the reports began to be distributed into the West through pro-Soviety, left-leaning media outlets and extreme right-wing ones prone to conspiracy theories (such as the fring Lyndon LaRouche movement). The operation was a remarkable success, but it took four years to reach fruition. "
